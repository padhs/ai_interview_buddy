1801,Number of Orders in the Backlog,"You are given a 2D integer array orders , where each orders[i] = [price i , amount i , orderType i ] denotes that amount i orders have been placed of type orderType i at the price price i . The orderType i is: 0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or 1 if it is a batch of sell orders. Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amount i independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i . There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens: If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog. Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog. Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input . Since this number can be large, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . Example 1: Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]] Output: 6 Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders: - 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog. - 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog. - 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog. - 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3 rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4 th order is added to the backlog. Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6. Example 2: Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]] Output: 999999984 Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders: - 10 9 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 10 9 orders are added to the backlog. - 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog. - 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog. - 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog. Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (10 9 + 7).

1810,Minimum Path Cost in a Hidden Grid,"This is an interactive problem . There is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size m x n , and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked. Each cell has a cost that you need to pay each time you move to the cell. The starting cell's cost is not applied before the robot moves. You want to find the minimum total cost to move the robot to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the GridMaster object. The GridMaster class has the following functions: boolean canMove(char direction) Returns true if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns false . int move(char direction) Moves the robot in that direction and returns the cost of moving to that cell. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored , the robot will remain in the same position, and the function will return -1 . boolean isTarget() Returns true if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns false . Note that direction in the above functions should be a character from {'U','D','L','R'} , representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively. Return the minimum total cost to get the robot from its initial starting cell to the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return -1 . Custom testing: The test input is read as a 2D matrix grid of size m x n and four integers r1 , c1 , r2 , and c2 where: grid[i][j] == 0 indicates that the cell (i, j) is blocked. grid[i][j] >= 1 indicates that the cell (i, j) is empty and grid[i][j] is the cost to move to that cell. (r1, c1) is the starting cell of the robot. (r2, c2) is the target cell of the robot. Remember that you will not have this information in your code. Example 1: Input: grid = [[2,3],[1,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 1, r2 = 1, c2 = 0 Output: 2 Explanation: One possible interaction is described below: The robot is initially standing on cell (0, 1), denoted by the 3. - master.canMove('U') returns false. - master.canMove('D') returns true. - master.canMove('L') returns true. - master.canMove('R') returns false. - master.move('L') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0) and returns 2. - master.isTarget() returns false. - master.canMove('U') returns false. - master.canMove('D') returns true. - master.canMove('L') returns false. - master.canMove('R') returns true. - master.move('D') moves the robot to the cell (1, 0) and returns 1. - master.isTarget() returns true. - master.move('L') doesn't move the robot and returns -1. - master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (1, 1) and returns 1. We now know that the target is the cell (1, 0), and the minimum total cost to reach it is 2. Example 2: Input: grid = [[0,3,1],[3,4,2],[1,2,0]], r1 = 2, c1 = 0, r2 = 0, c2 = 2 Output: 9 Explanation: The minimum cost path is (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2). Example 3: Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 0, r2 = 1, c2 = 1 Output: -1 Explanation: There is no path from the robot to the target cell.

1826,Faulty Sensor,"An experiment is being conducted in a lab. To ensure accuracy, there are two sensors collecting data simultaneously. You are given two arrays sensor1 and sensor2 , where sensor1[i] and sensor2[i] are the i th data points collected by the two sensors. However, this type of sensor has a chance of being defective, which causes exactly one data point to be dropped. After the data is dropped, all the data points to the right of the dropped data are shifted one place to the left, and the last data point is replaced with some random value . It is guaranteed that this random value will not be equal to the dropped value. For example, if the correct data is [1,2, 3 ,4,5] and 3 is dropped, the sensor could return [1,2,4,5, 7 ] (the last position can be any value, not just 7 ). We know that there is a defect in at most one of the sensors. Return the sensor number ( 1 or 2 ) with the defect. If there is no defect in either sensor or if it is impossible to determine the defective sensor, return -1 . Example 1: Input: sensor1 = [2,3,4,5], sensor2 = [2,1,3,4] Output: 1 Explanation: Sensor 2 has the correct values. The second data point from sensor 2 is dropped, and the last value of sensor 1 is replaced by a 5. Example 2: Input: sensor1 = [2,2,2,2,2], sensor2 = [2,2,2,2,5] Output: -1 Explanation: It is impossible to determine which sensor has a defect. Dropping the last value for either sensor could produce the output for the other sensor. Example 3: Input: sensor1 = [2,3,2,2,3,2], sensor2 = [2,3,2,3,2,7] Output: 2 Explanation: Sensor 1 has the correct values.

To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n , where dist[i] describes the length of the i th road in kilometers . In addition, you are given an integer speed , which is the speed (in km/h ) you will travel at. After you travel road i , you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting. For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait. However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks. For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.

If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1. Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2. Example 2: Input: n = 100 Output: 14 Explanation: One optimal strategy is: - Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9. - If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops.

1888,Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating,"You are given a binary string s . You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence: Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string. Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa. Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating . The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the strings ""010"" and ""1010"" are alternating, while the string ""0100"" is not. Example 1: Input: s = ""111000"" Output: 2 Explanation : Use the first operation two times to make s = ""100011"". Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = ""10 1 01 0 "". Example 2: Input: s = ""010"" Output: 0 Explanation : The string is already alternating.

1889,Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging,"You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box . There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box. The package sizes are given as an integer array packages , where packages[i] is the size of the i th package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes , where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the j th supplier produces. You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized . For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package . The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes. For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8] , you can fit the packages of size- 2 and size- 3 into two boxes of size- 4 and the package with size- 5 into a box of size- 8 . This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6 . Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally , or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large , return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . Example 1: Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]] Output: 6 Explanation : It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two size-4 boxes and one size-8 box. The total waste is (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6. Example 2: Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]] Output: -1 Explanation: There is no box that the package of size 5 can fit in. Example 3: Input: packages = [3,5,8,10,11,12], boxes = [[12],[11,9],[10,5,14]] Output: 9 Explanation: It is optimal to choose the third supplier, using two size-5 boxes, two size-10 boxes, and two size-14 boxes.

The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.). The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1 ). In each round, the i th player from the front of the row competes against the i th player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round. For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 Player 1 competes against player 7 . Player 2 competes against player 6 . Player 4 automatically advances to the next round. After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order). The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round. Given the integers n , firstPlayer , and secondPlayer , return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively .

You are given a 2D integer array segments , where segments[i] = [start i , end i , color i ] represents the half-closed segment [start i , end i ) with color i as the color. The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors. For example, if colors 2 , 4 , and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6} . For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set. You want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors.

1948,Delete Duplicate Folders in System,"Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths , where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the i th folder in the file system. For example, [""one"", ""two"", ""three""] represents the path ""/one/two/three"" . Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical , then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders. For example, folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked: /a /a/x /a/x/y /a/z /b /b/x /b/x/y /b/z However, if the file structure also included the path ""/b/w"" , then the folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" would not be identical. Note that ""/a/x"" and ""/b/x"" would still be considered identical even with the added folder. Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted. Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order . Example 1: Input: paths = [[""a""],[""c""],[""d""],[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""b""],[""d"",""a""]] Output: [[""d""],[""d"",""a""]] Explanation: The file structure is as shown. Folders ""/a"" and ""/c"" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named ""b"". Example 2: Input: paths = [[""a""],[""c""],[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""b""],[""a"",""b"",""x""],[""a"",""b"",""x"",""y""],[""w""],[""w"",""y""]] Output: [[""c""],[""c"",""b""],[""a""],[""a"",""b""]] Explanation: The file structure is as shown. Folders ""/a/b/x"" and ""/w"" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named ""y"". Note that folders ""/a"" and ""/c"" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand. Example 3: Input: paths = [[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""d""],[""c""],[""a""]] Output: [[""c""],[""c"",""d""],[""a""],[""a"",""b""]] Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system. Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter. Constraints: 1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10 4 1 <= paths[i].length <= 500 1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10 1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 10 5 path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.

1966,Binary Searchable Numbers in an Unsorted Array,"Consider a function that implements an algorithm similar to Binary Search . The function has two input parameters: sequence is a sequence of integers, and target is an integer value. The purpose of the function is to find if the target exists in the sequence . The pseudocode of the function is as follows: func(sequence, target) while sequence is not empty randomly choose an element from sequence as the pivot if pivot = target, return true else if pivot < target, remove pivot and all elements to its left from the sequence else, remove pivot and all elements to its right from the sequence end while return false When the sequence is sorted, the function works correctly for all values. When the sequence is not sorted, the function does not work for all values, but may still work for some values. Given an integer array nums , representing the sequence , that contains unique numbers and may or may not be sorted , return the number of values that are guaranteed to be found using the function, for every possible pivot selection . Example 1: Input: nums = [7] Output: 1 Explanation : Searching for value 7 is guaranteed to be found. Since the sequence has only one element, 7 will be chosen as the pivot. Because the pivot equals the target, the function will return true. Example 2: Input: nums = [-1,5,2] Output: 1 Explanation : Searching for value -1 is guaranteed to be found. If -1 was chosen as the pivot, the function would return true. If 5 was chosen as the pivot, 5 and 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have only -1 and the function would return true. If 2 was chosen as the pivot, 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have -1 and 5. No matter which number was chosen as the next pivot, the function would find -1 and return true. Searching for value 5 is NOT guaranteed to be found. If 2 was chosen as the pivot, -1, 5 and 2 would be removed. The sequence would be empty and the function would return false. Searching for value 2 is NOT guaranteed to be found. If 5 was chosen as the pivot, 5 and 2 would be removed. In the next loop, the sequence would have only -1 and the function would return false.

Consider an array nums ( 1-indexed ) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2 p - 1] in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times: Choose two elements x and y from nums . Choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y . Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer. For example, if x = 11 0 1 and y = 00 1 1 , after swapping the 2 nd bit from the right, we have x = 11 1 1 and y = 00 0 1 . Find the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product modulo 10 9 + 7 . Note: The answer should be the minimum product before the modulo operation is done. Example 1: Input: p = 1 Output: 1 Explanation: nums = [1]. There is only one element, so the product equals that element. Example 2: Input: p = 2 Output: 6 Explanation: nums = [01, 10, 11]. Any swap would either make the product 0 or stay the same. Thus, the array product of 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 is already minimized.

Table: Exam +---------------+------+ | Column Name | Type | +---------------+------+ | score | int | | student_count | int | +---------------+------+ score is the column with unique values for this table. Each row in this table indicates that there are student_count students that got at least score points in the exam. The data in this table will be logically correct, meaning a row recording a higher score will have the same or smaller student_count compared to a row recording a lower score. More formally, for every two rows i and j in the table, if score i > score j then student_count i <= student_count j . Every year, each school announces a minimum score requirement that a student needs to apply to it. The school chooses the minimum score requirement based on the exam results of all the students: They want to ensure that even if every student meeting the requirement applies, the school can accept everyone. They also want to maximize the possible number of students that can apply. They must use a score that is in the Exam table. Write a solution to report the minimum score requirement for each school. If there are multiple score values satisfying the above conditions, choose the smallest one. If the input data is not enough to determine the score, report -1 . Return the result table in any order .

2014,Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times,"You are given a string s of length n , and an integer k . You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s . A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s , where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times. For example, ""bba"" is repeated 2 times in the string ""bababcba"" , because the string ""bbabba"" , constructed by concatenating ""bba"" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "" b a bab c ba "" . Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s . If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string . Example 1: Input: s = ""letsleetcode"", k = 2 Output: ""let"" Explanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: ""let"" and ""ete"". ""let"" is the lexicographically largest one. Example 2: Input: s = ""bb"", k = 2 Output: ""b"" Explanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is ""b"".

2015,Average Height of Buildings in Each Segment,"A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has building(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array buildings , where buildings[i] = [start i , end i , height i ] . This means that there is a building with height i in the half-closed segment [start i , end i ) . You want to describe the heights of the buildings on the street with the minimum number of non-overlapping segments . The street can be represented by the 2D integer array street where street[j] = [left j , right j , average j ] describes a half-closed segment [left j , right j ) of the road where the average heights of the buildings in the segment is average j . For example, if buildings = [[1,5,2],[3,10,4]], the street could be represented by street = [[1,3,2],[3,5,3],[5,10,4]] because: From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2 . From 3 to 5, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of (2+4) / 2 = 3 . From 5 to 10, there is only the second building with an average height of 4 / 1 = 4 . Given buildings , return the 2D integer array street as described above ( excluding any areas of the street where there are no buldings). You may return the array in any order . The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided ( integer division ) by n . A half-closed segment [a, b) is the section of the number line between points a and b including point a and not including point b . Example 1: Input: buildings = [[1,4,2],[3,9,4]] Output: [[1,3,2],[3,4,3],[4,9,4]] Explanation: From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2. From 3 to 4, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of (2+4) / 2 = 3. From 4 to 9, there is only the second building with an average height of 4 / 1 = 4. Example 2: Input: buildings = [[1,3,2],[2,5,3],[2,8,3]] Output: [[1,3,2],[3,8,3]] Explanation: From 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2. From 2 to 3, all three buildings are there with an average height of (2+3+3) / 3 = 2. From 3 to 5, both the second and the third building are there with an average height of (3+3) / 2 = 3. From 5 to 8, there is only the last building with an average height of 3 / 1 = 3. The average height from 1 to 3 is the same so we can group them into one segment. The average height from 3 to 8 is the same so we can group them into one segment. Example 3: Input: buildings = [[1,2,1],[5,6,1]] Output: [[1,2,1],[5,6,1]] Explanation: From 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of 1 / 1 = 1. From 2 to 5, there are no buildings, so it is not included in the output. From 5 to 6, there is only the second building with an average height of 1 / 1 = 1.

2029,Stone Game IX,"Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. There is a row of n stones, and each stone has an associated value. You are given an integer array stones , where stones[i] is the value of the i th stone. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from stones . The player who removes a stone loses if the sum of the values of all removed stones is divisible by 3 . Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn). Assuming both players play optimally , return true if Alice wins and false if Bob wins . Example 1: Input: stones = [2,1] Output: true Explanation: The game will be played as follows: - Turn 1: Alice can remove either stone. - Turn 2: Bob removes the remaining stone. The sum of the removed stones is 1 + 2 = 3 and is divisible by 3. Therefore, Bob loses and Alice wins the game. Example 2: Input: stones = [2] Output: false Explanation: Alice will remove the only stone, and the sum of the values on the removed stones is 2. Since all the stones are removed and the sum of values is not divisible by 3, Bob wins the game. Example 3: Input: stones = [5,1,2,4,3] Output: false Explanation: Bob will always win. One possible way for Bob to win is shown below: - Turn 1: Alice can remove the second stone with value 1. Sum of removed stones = 1. - Turn 2: Bob removes the fifth stone with value 3. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 = 4. - Turn 3: Alices removes the fourth stone with value 4. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. - Turn 4: Bob removes the third stone with value 2.

2039,The Time When the Network Becomes Idle,"There is a network of n servers, labeled from 0 to n - 1 . You are given a 2D integer array edges , where edges[i] = [u i , v i ] indicates there is a message channel between servers u i and v i , and they can pass any number of messages to each other directly in one second. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array patience of length n . All servers are connected , i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels. The server labeled 0 is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally , so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through. At the beginning of second 0 , each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1 , at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server: If it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed since the last time the message was sent from this server. Otherwise, no more resending will occur from this server. The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers. Return the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle .

At second 1, - Message 1A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back. - Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message. - Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B). At second 2, - The reply 1A arrives at server 1. No more resending will occur from server 1. - Message 2A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 2A instantly and sends a reply 2A back. - Server 2 resends the message (denoted 2C). ... At second 4, - The reply 2A arrives at server 2. No more resending will occur from server 2. ... At second 7, reply 2D arrives at server 2.

Your task is to separate sentence into rows where the number of characters in each row is at most k . You may assume that sentence does not begin or end with a space, and the words in sentence are separated by a single space. You can split sentence into rows by inserting line breaks between words in sentence . A word cannot be split between two rows. Each word must be used exactly once, and the word order cannot be rearranged. Adjacent words in a row should be separated by a single space, and rows should not begin or end with spaces. The cost of a row with length n is (k - n) 2 , and the total cost is the sum of the costs for all rows except the last one. For example if sentence = ""i love leetcode"" and k = 12 : Separating sentence into ""i"" , ""love"" , and ""leetcode"" has a cost of (12 - 1) 2 + (12 - 4) 2 = 185 . Separating sentence into ""i love"" , and ""leetcode"" has a cost of (12 - 6) 2 = 36 . Separating sentence into ""i"" , and ""love leetcode"" is not possible because the length of ""love leetcode"" is greater than k .

2100,Find Good Days to Rob the Bank,"You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array security , where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the i th day. The days are numbered starting from 0 . You are also given an integer time . The i th day is a good day to rob the bank if: There are at least time days before and after the i th day, The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing , and The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing . More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time] . Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank . The order that the days are returned in does not matter. Example 1: Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2 Output: [2,3] Explanation: On day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4]. On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5]. No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank. Example 2: Input: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0 Output: [0,1,2,3,4] Explanation: Since time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day. Example 3: Input: security = [1,2,3,4,5,6], time = 2 Output: [] Explanation: No day has 2 days before it that have a non-increasing number of guards. Thus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list.

2101,Detonate the Maximum Bombs,"You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb. The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where bombs[i] = [x i , y i , r i ] . x i and y i denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the i th bomb, whereas r i denotes the radius of its range. You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges. Given the list of bombs , return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb . Example 1: Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]] Output: 2 Explanation: The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs. If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected. But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated. So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2. Example 2: Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]] Output: 1 Explanation: Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1. Example 3: Input: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]] Output: 5 Explanation: The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because: - Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0. - Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2. - Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.

You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports: Adding scenic locations, one at a time . Querying the i th best location of all locations already added , where i is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query). For example, when the system is queried for the 4 th time, it returns the 4 th best location of all locations already added. Note that the test data are generated so that at any time , the number of queries does not exceed the number of locations added to the system. Implement the SORTracker class: SORTracker() Initializes the tracker system. void add(string name, int score) Adds a scenic location with name and score to the system. string get() Queries and returns the i th best location, where i is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).

2105,Watering Plants II,"Alice and Bob want to water n plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the i th plant is located at x = i . Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full . They water the plants in the following way: Alice waters the plants in order from left to right , starting from the 0 th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left , starting from the (n - 1) th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously . It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs. Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant. In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant. Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the i th plant needs, and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants . Example 1: Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5 Output: 1 Explanation: - Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans. - Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3. - Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively. - Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it. So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. Example 2: Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: - Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively. - Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3. - Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively. - Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants. So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. Example 3: Input: plants = [5], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8 Output: 0 Explanation: - There is only one plant. - Alice's watering can has 10 units of water, whereas Bob's can has 8 units.

The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i , where k <= i <= n-1 . For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because: arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5) arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2) arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6) arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2) However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1] ) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3] ). In one operation , you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer. Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k . Example 1: Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1 Output: 4 Explanation: For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing. Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5, 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ], [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ,1], [ 2 , 2 ,3, 4 , 4 ]. All of them require 4 operations. It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] because it would take 5 operations. It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations. Example 2: Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2 Output: 0 Explanation: This is the same example as the one in the problem description. Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i]. Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations. Example 3: Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5. One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5. The array will now be [4,1,5, 4 ,6, 5 ]. Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

2117,Abbreviating the Product of a Range,"You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right . Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right] . Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps: Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C . For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000 , and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546 . Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d . If d > 10 , then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10 , we keep it unchanged. For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321 , but 1234567 is represented as 1234567 . Finally, represent the product as a string ""<pre>...<suf>eC"" . For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as ""12345...89876e5"" . Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right] . Example 1: Input: left = 1, right = 4 Output: ""24e0"" Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24. There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with ""e0"". Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further. Thus, the final representation is ""24e0"". Example 2: Input: left = 2, right = 11 Output: ""399168e2"" Explanation: The product is 39916800. There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with ""e2"". The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further. Hence, the abbreviated product is ""399168e2"". Example 3: Input: left = 371, right = 375 Output: ""7219856259e3"" Explanation: The product is 7219856259000.

However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher , but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array. Given an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher , return the original array arr .

Example 1: Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12] Output: [3,7,11] Explanation: If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12]. Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums. Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. Example 2: Input: nums = [1,1,3,3] Output: [2,2] Explanation: If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3]. Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums. Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0. This is invalid since k must be positive.

However, every time you pour k gallons of water, you spill loss percent of k . Return the maximum amount of water in each bucket after making the amount of water equal. Answers within 10 -5 of the actual answer will be accepted. Example 1: Input: buckets = [1,2,7], loss = 80 Output: 2.00000 Explanation: Pour 5 gallons of water from buckets[2] to buckets[0]. 5 * 80% = 4 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 5 - 4 = 1 gallon of water. All buckets have 2 gallons of water in them so return 2. Example 2: Input: buckets = [2,4,6], loss = 50 Output: 3.50000 Explanation: Pour 0.5 gallons of water from buckets[1] to buckets[0]. 0.5 * 50% = 0.25 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 gallons of water. Now, buckets = [2.25, 3.5, 6]. Pour 2.5 gallons of water from buckets[2] to buckets[0]. 2.5 * 50% = 1.25 gallons are spilled and buckets[0] only receives 2.5 - 1.25 = 1.25 gallons of water. All buckets have 3.5 gallons of water in them so return 3.5. Example 3: Input: buckets = [3,3,3,3], loss = 40 Output: 3.00000 Explanation: All buckets already have the same amount of water in them.

2138,Divide a String Into Groups of Size k,"A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure: The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group. For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group. Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s . Given the string s , the size of each group k and the character fill , return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure . Example 1: Input: s = ""abcdefghi"", k = 3, fill = ""x"" Output: [""abc"",""def"",""ghi""] Explanation: The first 3 characters ""abc"" form the first group. The next 3 characters ""def"" form the second group. The last 3 characters ""ghi"" form the third group. Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill. Thus, the groups formed are ""abc"", ""def"", and ""ghi"". Example 2: Input: s = ""abcdefghij"", k = 3, fill = ""x"" Output: [""abc"",""def"",""ghi"",""jxx""] Explanation: Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups ""abc"", ""def"", and ""ghi"". For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice. Thus, the 4 groups formed are ""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi"", and ""jxx"".

2145,Count the Hidden Sequences,"You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences , which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1) . More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden , then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i] . You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain. For example, given differences = [1, -3, 4] , lower = 1 , upper = 6 , the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 ( inclusive ). [3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences. [5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6 . [1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct. Return the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0 . Example 1: Input: differences = [1,-3,4], lower = 1, upper = 6 Output: 2 Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are: - [3, 4, 1, 5] - [4, 5, 2, 6] Thus, we return 2.

2146,K Highest Ranked Items Within a Price Range,"You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following: 0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through. 1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from. All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells. It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells. You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high] ( inclusive ). You are further given an integer k . You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different: Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start ( shorter distance has a higher rank). Price ( lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range ). The row number ( smaller row number has a higher rank). The column number ( smaller column number has a higher rank). Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest) . If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them . Example 1: Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,0,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,5], start = [0,0], k = 3 Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]] Explanation: You start at (0,0). With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2). The ranks of these items are: - (0,1) with distance 1 - (1,1) with distance 2 - (2,1) with distance 3 - (2,2) with distance 4 Thus, the 3 highest ranked items in the price range are (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1). Example 2: Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,3,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,3], start = [2,3], k = 2 Output: [[2,1],[1,2]] Explanation: You start at (2,3). With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1). The ranks of these items are: - (2,1) with distance 2, price 2 - (1,2) with distance 2, price 3 - (1,1) with distance 3 - (0,1) with distance 4 Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2). Example 3: Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3 Output: [[2,1],[2,0]] Explanation: You start at (0,0). With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). The ranks of these items are: - (2,1) with distance 5 - (2,0) with distance 6 Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0).

2162,Minimum Cost to Set Cooking Time,"A generic microwave supports cooking times for: at least 1 second. at most 99 minutes and 99 seconds. To set the cooking time, you push at most four digits . The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes . It interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example, You push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds. You push 0 0 0 8 (four digits). It is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds. You push 8 0 9 0 . It is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds. You push 8 1 3 0 . It is interpreted as 81 minutes and 30 seconds. You are given integers startAt , moveCost , pushCost , and targetSeconds . Initially , your finger is on the digit startAt . Moving the finger above any specific digit costs moveCost units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger once costs pushCost units of fatigue. There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for targetSeconds seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost. Return the minimum cost to set targetSeconds seconds of cooking time . Remember that one minute consists of 60 seconds. Example 1: Input: startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600 Output: 6 Explanation: The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time. - 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds. The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1). The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost. - 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds. The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1). The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12. - 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1). The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9. Example 2: Input: startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76 Output: 6 Explanation: The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.

2163,Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements. You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums . The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts: The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sum first . The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sum second . The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sum first - sum second . For example, if sum first = 3 and sum second = 2 , their difference is 1 . Similarly, if sum first = 2 and sum second = 3 , their difference is -1 . Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements . Example 1: Input: nums = [3,1,2] Output: -1 Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts. - If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1. - If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1. - If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2. The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. Example 2: Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3] Output: 1 Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each. If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12. To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1. It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order. Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums . Example 1: Input: nums = [4,1,2,3] Output: [2,3,4,1] Explanation: First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order. So, nums changes from [4, 1 ,2, 3 ] to [4, 3 ,2, 1 ]. Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order. So, nums changes from [ 4 ,1, 2 ,3] to [ 2 ,3, 4 ,1]. Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1]. Example 2: Input: nums = [2,1] Output: [2,1] Explanation: Since there is exactly one odd index and one even index, no rearrangement of values takes place.

Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669. 338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros. 38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros. Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38. Thus, the sorted array is [338,38,991]. Example 2: Input: mapping = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], nums = [789,456,123] Output: [123,456,789] Explanation: 789 maps to 789, 456 maps to 456, and 123 maps to 123. Thus, the sorted array is [123,456,789].

Return the maximum number of times pattern can occur as a subsequence of the modified text . A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. Example 1: Input: text = ""abdcdbc"", pattern = ""ac"" Output: 4 Explanation: If we add pattern[0] = 'a' in between text[1] and text[2], we get ""ab a dcdbc"". Now, the number of times ""ac"" occurs as a subsequence is 4. Some other strings which have 4 subsequences ""ac"" after adding a character to text are "" a abdcdbc"" and ""abd a cdbc"". However, strings such as ""abdc a dbc"", ""abd c cdbc"", and ""abdcdbc c "", although obtainable, have only 3 subsequences ""ac"" and are thus suboptimal. It can be shown that it is not possible to get more than 4 subsequences ""ac"" by adding only one character.

Each moving car has the same speed . The number of collisions can be calculated as follows: When two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by 2 . When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1 . After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion. Return the total number of collisions that will happen on the road . Example 1: Input: directions = ""RLRSLL"" Output: 5 Explanation: The collisions that will happen on the road are: - Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2. - Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3. - Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4. - Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5. Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5. Example 2: Input: directions = ""LLRR"" Output: 0 Explanation: No cars will collide with each other.

2212,Maximum Points in an Archery Competition,"Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules: Alice first shoots numArrows arrows and then Bob shoots numArrows arrows. The points are then calculated as follows: The target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive . For each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11 ), say Alice and Bob have shot a k and b k arrows on that section respectively. If a k >= b k , then Alice takes k points. If a k < b k , then Bob takes k points. However, if a k == b k == 0 , then nobody takes k points. For example, if Alice and Bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11 , then Alice takes 11 points. On the other hand, if Alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and Bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then Bob takes 11 points. You are given the integer numArrows and an integer array aliceArrows of size 12 , which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11 . Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain. Return the array bobArrows which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11 .

2223,Sum of Scores of Built Strings,"You are building a string s of length n one character at a time, prepending each new character to the front of the string. The strings are labeled from 1 to n , where the string with length i is labeled s i . For example, for s = ""abaca"" , s 1 == ""a"" , s 2 == ""ca"" , s 3 == ""aca"" , etc. The score of s i is the length of the longest common prefix between s i and s n (Note that s == s n ). Given the final string s , return the sum of the score of every s i . Example 1: Input: s = ""babab"" Output: 9 Explanation: For s 1 == ""b"", the longest common prefix is ""b"" which has a score of 1. For s 2 == ""ab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0. For s 3 == ""bab"", the longest common prefix is ""bab"" which has a score of 3. For s 4 == ""abab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0. For s 5 == ""babab"", the longest common prefix is ""babab"" which has a score of 5. The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9. Example 2: Input: s = ""azbazbzaz"" Output: 14 Explanation: For s 2 == ""az"", the longest common prefix is ""az"" which has a score of 2.

2241,Design an ATM Machine,"There is an ATM machine that stores banknotes of 5 denominations: 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , and 500 dollars. Initially the ATM is empty. The user can use the machine to deposit or withdraw any amount of money. When withdrawing, the machine prioritizes using banknotes of larger values. For example, if you want to withdraw 300 and there are 2 50 banknotes, 1 100 banknote, and 1 200 banknote, then the machine will use the 100 and 200 banknotes. However, if you try to withdraw 600 and there are 3 200 banknotes and 1 500 banknote, then the withdraw request will be rejected because the machine will first try to use the 500 banknote and then be unable to use banknotes to complete the remaining 100 . Note that the machine is not allowed to use the 200 banknotes instead of the 500 banknote. Implement the ATM class: ATM() Initializes the ATM object. void deposit(int[] banknotesCount) Deposits new banknotes in the order 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , and 500 . int[] withdraw(int amount) Returns an array of length 5 of the number of banknotes that will be handed to the user in the order 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , and 500 , and update the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [a i , b i ] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes a i and b i . A node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions: There is an edge connecting every pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence. No node appears more than once in the sequence. The score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the scores of the nodes in the sequence. Return the maximum score of a valid node sequence with a length of 4 . If no such sequence exists, return -1 . Example 1: Input: scores = [5,2,9,8,4], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]] Output: 24 Explanation: The figure above shows the graph and the chosen node sequence [0,1,2,3]. The score of the node sequence is 5 + 2 + 9 + 8 = 24. It can be shown that no other node sequence has a score of more than 24. Note that the sequences [3,1,2,0] and [1,0,2,3] are also valid and have a score of 24. The sequence [0,3,2,4] is not valid since no edge connects nodes 0 and 3.

2243,Calculate Digit Sum of a String,"You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k . A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k . In one round, do the following: Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k . Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, ""346"" is replaced with ""13"" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 . Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k , repeat from step 1 . Return s after all rounds have been completed . Example 1: Input: s = ""11111222223"", k = 3 Output: ""135"" Explanation: - For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: ""111"", ""112"", ""222"", and ""23"". âââââThen we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. So, s becomes ""3"" + ""4"" + ""6"" + ""5"" = ""3465"" after the first round. - For the second round, we divide s into ""346"" and ""5"". Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. So, s becomes ""13"" + ""5"" = ""135"" after second round. Now, s.length <= k, so we return ""135"" as the answer. Example 2: Input: s = ""00000000"", k = 3 Output: ""000"" Explanation: We divide s into ""000"", ""000"", and ""00"". Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. s becomes ""0"" + ""0"" + ""0"" = ""000"", whose length is equal to k, so we return ""000"".

2245,Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path,"You are given a 2D integer array grid of size m x n , where each cell contains a positive integer. A cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either horizontally or vertically up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the alternate direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell. The product of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path. Return the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path found in grid . Note: Horizontal movement means moving in either the left or right direction. Vertical movement means moving in either the up or down direction.

2258,Escape the Spreading Fire,"You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n which represents a field. Each cell has one of three values: 0 represents grass, 1 represents fire, 2 represents a wall that you and fire cannot pass through. You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0) , and you want to travel to the safehouse at the bottom-right cell, (m - 1, n - 1) . Every minute, you may move to an adjacent grass cell. After your move, every fire cell will spread to all adjacent cells that are not walls. Return the maximum number of minutes that you can stay in your initial position before moving while still safely reaching the safehouse . If this is impossible, return -1 . If you can always reach the safehouse regardless of the minutes stayed, return 10 9 . Note that even if the fire spreads to the safehouse immediately after you have reached it, it will be counted as safely reaching the safehouse. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching). Example 1: Input: grid = [[0,2,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2,2,1,0],[0,2,0,0,1,2,0],[0,0,2,2,2,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]] Output: 3 Explanation: The figure above shows the scenario where you stay in the initial position for 3 minutes. You will still be able to safely reach the safehouse. Staying for more than 3 minutes will not allow you to safely reach the safehouse. Example 2: Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,0],[0,2,0,0]] Output: -1 Explanation: The figure above shows the scenario where you immediately move towards the safehouse. Fire will spread to any cell you move towards and it is impossible to safely reach the safehouse. Thus, -1 is returned. Example 3: Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[2,2,0],[1,2,0]] Output: 1000000000 Explanation: The figure above shows the initial grid. Notice that the fire is contained by walls and you will always be able to safely reach the safehouse. Thus, 10 9 is returned.

The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split. - Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split. - Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split. Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2. Example 2: Input: nums = [2,3,1,0] Output: 2 Explanation: There are two valid splits in nums: - Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [2,3], and its sum is 5. The second part is [1,0], and its sum is 1. Since 5 >= 1, i = 1 is a valid split. - Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [2,3,1], and its sum is 6. The second part is [0], and its sum is 0.

2273,Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams,"You are given a 0-indexed string array words , where words[i] consists of lowercase English letters. In one operation, select any index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] and words[i] are anagrams , and delete words[i] from words . Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions. Return words after performing all operations . It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, ""dacb"" is an anagram of ""abdc"" . Example 1: Input: words = [""abba"",""baba"",""bbaa"",""cd"",""cd""] Output: [""abba"",""cd""] Explanation: One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations: - Since words[2] = ""bbaa"" and words[1] = ""baba"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2]. Now words = [""abba"",""baba"",""cd"",""cd""]. - Since words[1] = ""baba"" and words[0] = ""abba"" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1]. Now words = [""abba"",""cd"",""cd""]. - Since words[2] = ""cd"" and words[1] = ""cd"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2]. Now words = [""abba"",""cd""]. We can no longer perform any operations, so [""abba"",""cd""] is the final answer. Example 2: Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""] Output: [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""] Explanation: No two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.

2286,Booking Concert Tickets in Groups,"A concert hall has n rows numbered from 0 to n - 1 , each with m seats, numbered from 0 to m - 1 . You need to design a ticketing system that can allocate seats in the following cases: If a group of k spectators can sit together in a row. If every member of a group of k spectators can get a seat. They may or may not sit together. Note that the spectators are very picky. Hence: They will book seats only if each member of their group can get a seat with row number less than or equal to maxRow . maxRow can vary from group to group. In case there are multiple rows to choose from, the row with the smallest number is chosen. If there are multiple seats to choose in the same row, the seat with the smallest number is chosen. Implement the BookMyShow class: BookMyShow(int n, int m) Initializes the object with n as number of rows and m as number of seats per row. int[] gather(int k, int maxRow) Returns an array of length 2 denoting the row and seat number (respectively) of the first seat being allocated to the k members of the group, who must sit together . In other words, it returns the smallest possible r and c such that all [c, c + k - 1] seats are valid and empty in row r , and r <= maxRow . Returns [] in case it is not possible to allocate seats to the group. boolean scatter(int k, int maxRow) Returns true if all k members of the group can be allocated seats in rows 0 to maxRow , who may or may not sit together. If the seats can be allocated, it allocates k seats to the group with the smallest row numbers, and the smallest possible seat numbers in each row. Otherwise, returns false . Example 1: Input [""BookMyShow"", ""gather"", ""gather"", ""scatter"", ""scatter""] [[2, 5], [4, 0], [2, 0], [5, 1], [5, 1]] Output [null, [0, 0], [], true, false] Explanation BookMyShow bms = new BookMyShow(2, 5); // There are 2 rows with 5 seats each bms.gather(4, 0); // return [0, 0] // The group books seats [0, 3] of row 0. bms.gather(2, 0); // return [] // There is only 1 seat left in row 0, // so it is not possible to book 2 consecutive seats. bms.scatter(5, 1); // return True // The group books seat 4 of row 0 and seats [0, 3] of row 1. bms.scatter(5, 1); // return False // There is only one seat left in the hall.

Determine the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied: The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to 1 . There is at least a gap of 2 rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the i th roll is equal to the value of the j th roll, then abs(i - j) > 2 . Return the total number of distinct sequences possible . Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different. Example 1: Input: n = 4 Output: 184 Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2, 3, 4), (6, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3, 1), etc. Some invalid sequences are (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3, 6). (1, 2, 1, 3) is invalid since the first and third roll have an equal value and abs(1 - 3) = 2 (i and j are 1-indexed). (1, 2, 3, 6) is invalid since the greatest common divisor of 3 and 6 = 3.

Picking up one unit of any type of garbage takes 1 minute. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array travel where travel[i] is the number of minutes needed to go from house i to house i + 1 . There are three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house 0 and must visit each house in order ; however, they do not need to visit every house. Only one garbage truck may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up garbage, the other two trucks cannot do anything. Return the minimum number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage. Example 1: Input: garbage = [""G"",""P"",""GP"",""GG""], travel = [2,4,3] Output: 21 Explanation: The paper garbage truck: 1. Travels from house 0 to house 1 2.

You are also given: a 2D integer array rowConditions of size n where rowConditions[i] = [above i , below i ] , and a 2D integer array colConditions of size m where colConditions[i] = [left i , right i ] . The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k . You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once . The remaining cells should have the value 0 . The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions: The number above i should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number below i appears for all i from 0 to n - 1 . The number left i should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number right i appears for all i from 0 to m - 1 . Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions . If no answer exists, return an empty matrix. Example 1: Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]] Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]] Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions. The row conditions are the following: - Number 1 is in row 1 , and number 2 is in row 2 , so 1 is above 2 in the matrix. - Number 3 is in row 0 , and number 2 is in row 2 , so 3 is above 2 in the matrix. The column conditions are the following: - Number 2 is in column 1 , and number 1 is in column 2 , so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix. - Number 3 is in column 0 , and number 2 is in column 1 , so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix. Note that there may be multiple correct answers. Example 2: Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]] Output: [] Explanation: From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.

Example 1: Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2 Output: 3 Explanation: One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above. We choose s = {0, 2}. - Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1. - Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s. - Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s. - Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s. Thus, we can cover three rows. Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered. Example 2: Input: matrix = [[1],[0]], numSelect = 1 Output: 2 Explanation: Selecting the only column will result in both rows being covered since the entire matrix is selected.

2462,Total Cost to Hire K Workers,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the i th worker. You are also given two integers k and candidates . We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules: You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session. In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index. For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2 , then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4 th worker because they have the lowest cost [ 3,2 ,7,7, 1 ,2 ] . In the second hiring session, we will choose 1 st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4 th worker but they have the smallest index [ 3, 2 ,7, 7,2 ] . Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process. If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index. A worker can only be chosen once. Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers. Example 1: Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4 Output: 11 Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total.

You are also given a 2D integer array factory where factory[j] = [position j , limit j ] indicates that position j is the position of the j th factory and that the j th factory can repair at most limit j robots. The positions of each robot are unique . The positions of each factory are also unique . Note that a robot can be in the same position as a factory initially. All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving. At any moment , you can set the initial direction of moving for some robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. Return the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots . The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired. Note that All robots move at the same speed. If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide. If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other. If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist. If the robot moved from a position x to a position y , the distance it moved is |y - x| .

Find the maximum number in nums and remove it. Calculate the average of the two removed numbers. The average of two numbers a and b is (a + b) / 2 . For example, the average of 2 and 3 is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 . Return the number of distinct averages calculated using the above process . Note that when there is a tie for a minimum or maximum number, any can be removed. Example 1: Input: nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5] Output: 2 Explanation: 1.

2467,Most Profitable Path in a Tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 , rooted at node 0 . You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [a i , b i ] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a i and b i in the tree. At every node i , there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount , where amount[i] represents: the price needed to open the gate at node i , if amount[i] is negative, or, the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i , otherwise. The game goes on as follows: Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob . At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node , while Bob moves towards node 0 . For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that: If the gate is already open , no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward. If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously , they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c , then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c , both of them receive c / 2 each. If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0 , he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other. Return the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node. Example 1: Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6] Output: 6 Explanation: The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows: - Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes. Alice's net income is now -2. - Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward. Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0. - Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged. Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving. - Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6. Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends. It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income. Example 2: Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350] Output: -7280 Explanation: Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0. Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. Constraints: 2 <= n <= 10 5 edges.length == n - 1 edges[i].length == 2 0 <= a i , b i < n a i != b i edges represents a valid tree. 1 <= bob < n amount.length == n amount[i] is an even integer in the range [-10 4 , 10 4 ] .",https://leetcode.ca/2022-09-01-2467-Most-Profitable-Path-in-a-Tree

Each resulting part should have the suffix ""<a/b>"" , where ""b"" is to be replaced with the total number of parts and ""a"" is to be replaced with the index of the part, starting from 1 and going up to b . Additionally, the length of each resulting part (including its suffix) should be equal to limit , except for the last part whose length can be at most limit . The resulting parts should be formed such that when their suffixes are removed and they are all concatenated in order , they should be equal to message . Also, the result should contain as few parts as possible. Return the parts message would be split into as an array of strings . If it is impossible to split message as required, return an empty array .

The next 5 parts take 2 characters each to finish splitting message. In this example, each part, including the last, has length 9. It can be shown it is not possible to split message into less than 14 parts. Example 2: Input: message = ""short message"", limit = 15 Output: [""short mess<1/2>"",""age<2/2>""] Explanation: Under the given constraints, the string can be split into two parts: - The first part comprises of the first 10 characters, and has a length 15. - The next part comprises of the last 3 characters, and has a length 8.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range . In other words, if the range is denoted by r , then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1 . Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7 . The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from. The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones. Given the two integers r and k , return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally. Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities. Example 1: Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2 Output: 5 Explanation: One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0]. - City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations. - City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations. - City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations. - City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations. - City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.

You are given the two integers n and k , and a 2D integer array time of size k x 4 where time[i] = [leftToRight i , pickOld i , rightToLeft i , putNew i ] . The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. The old warehouse is on the right bank of the river, and the new warehouse is on the left bank of the river. Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the i th worker ( 0-indexed ) can : Cross the bridge from the left bank (new warehouse) to the right bank (old warehouse) in leftToRight i minutes. Pick a box from the old warehouse and return to the bridge in pickOld i minutes. Different workers can pick up their boxes simultaneously. Cross the bridge from the right bank (old warehouse) to the left bank (new warehouse) in rightToLeft i minutes. Put the box in the new warehouse and return to the bridge in putNew i minutes. Different workers can put their boxes simultaneously. A worker i is less efficient than a worker j if either condition is met: leftToRight i + rightToLeft i > leftToRight j + rightToLeft j leftToRight i + rightToLeft i == leftToRight j + rightToLeft j and i > j The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge : If a worker x reaches the bridge while another worker y is crossing the bridge, x waits at their side of the bridge. If the bridge is free, the worker waiting on the right side of the bridge gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the right side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.

The cost of a split is the sum of the importance value of each subarray in the split. Let trimmed(subarray) be the version of the subarray where all numbers which appear only once are removed. For example, trimmed([3,1,2,4,3,4]) = [3,4,3,4]. The importance value of a subarray is k + trimmed(subarray).length . For example, if a subarray is [1,2,3,3,3,4,4] , then trimmed( [1,2,3,3,3,4,4]) = [3,3,3,4,4]. The importance value of this subarray will be k + 5 . Return the minimum possible cost of a split of nums . A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

For the i th query, find the shortest substring of s whose decimal value , val , yields second i when bitwise XORed with first i . In other words, val ^ first i == second i . The answer to the i th query is the endpoints ( 0-indexed ) of the substring [left i , right i ] or [-1, -1] if no such substring exists. If there are multiple answers, choose the one with the minimum left i . Return an array ans where ans[i] = [left i , right i ] is the answer to the i th query. A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string. Example 1: Input: s = ""101101"", queries = [[0,5],[1,2]] Output: [[0,2],[2,3]] Explanation: For the first query the substring in range [0,2] is ""101"" which has a decimal value of 5 , and 5 ^ 0 = 5 , hence the answer to the first query is [0,2] . In the second query, the substring in range [2,3] is ""11"", and has a decimal value of 3 , and 3 ^ 1 = 2 . So, [2,3] is returned for the second query. Example 2: Input: s = ""0101"", queries = [[12,8]] Output: [[-1,-1]] Explanation: In this example there is no substring that answers the query, hence [-1,-1] is returned . Example 3: Input: s = ""1"", queries = [[4,5]] Output: [[0,0]] Explanation: For this example, the substring in range [0,0] has a decimal value of 1 , and 1 ^ 4 = 5 . So, the answer is [0,0] .

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., ""ace"" is a subsequence of "" a b c d e "" while ""aec"" is not). Example 1: Input: s = ""abacaba"", t = ""bzaa"" Output: 1 Explanation: In this example, we remove the character ""z"" at index 1 (0-indexed). The string t becomes ""baa"" which is a subsequence of the string ""abacaba"" and the score is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1. It can be proven that 1 is the minimum score that we can achieve. Example 2: Input: s = ""cde"", t = ""xyz"" Output: 3 Explanation: In this example, we remove characters ""x"", ""y"" and ""z"" at indices 0, 1, and 2 (0-indexed).

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum values Bob can make by remapping exactly one digit in num . Notes: When Bob remaps a digit d1 to another digit d2 , Bob replaces all occurrences of d1 in num with d2 . Bob can remap a digit to itself, in which case num does not change. Bob can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively. The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes. Example 1: Input: num = 11891 Output: 99009 Explanation: To achieve the maximum value, Bob can remap the digit 1 to the digit 9 to yield 99899. To achieve the minimum value, Bob can remap the digit 1 to the digit 0, yielding 890. The difference between these two numbers is 99009. Example 2: Input: num = 90 Output: 99 Explanation: The maximum value that can be returned by the function is 99 (if 0 is replaced by 9) and the minimum value that can be returned by the function is 0 (if 9 is replaced by 0).

The tree is represented as a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [a i , b i ] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a i and b i in the tree. Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following: Chooses two distinct integers u and v such that there exists an edge [u, v] in the tree. He tells Alice that u is the parent of v in the tree. Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array guesses where guesses[j] = [u j , v j ] indicates Bob guessed u j to be the parent of v j .

You can perform multiple operations on arr . In an operation, you can choose a subarray with size k and reverse the subarray. However, the 1 in arr should never go to any of the positions in banned .

Example 1: Input: n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4 Output: [0,-1,-1,1] Explanation: In this case k = 4 so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is 0 . We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1 . Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is 1 . Example 2: Input: n = 5, p = 0, banned = [2,4], k = 3 Output: [0,-1,-1,-1,-1] Explanation: In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is 0 . We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1 . Example 3: Input: n = 4, p = 2, banned = [0,1,3], k = 1 Output: [-1,-1,0,-1] Explanation: In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1. So the 1 never changes its position.

2616,Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer p . Find p pairs of indices of nums such that the maximum difference amongst all the pairs is minimized . Also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the p pairs. Note that for a pair of elements at the index i and j , the difference of this pair is |nums[i] - nums[j]| , where |x| represents the absolute value of x . Return the minimum maximum difference among all p pairs. We define the maximum of an empty set to be zero. Example 1: Input: nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3], p = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: The first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4, and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5. The maximum difference is max(|nums[1] - nums[4]|, |nums[2] - nums[5]|) = max(0, 1) = 1. Therefore, we return 1. Example 2: Input: nums = [4,2,1,2], p = 1 Output: 0 Explanation: Let the indices 1 and 3 form a pair. The difference of that pair is |2 - 2| = 0, which is the minimum we can attain.

2618,Check if Object Instance of Class,"Write a function that checks if a given value is an instance of a given class or superclass. For this problem, an object is considered an instance of a given class if that object has access to that class's methods. There are no constraints on the data types that can be passed to the function. For example, the value or the class could be undefined . Example 1: Input: func = () => checkIfInstanceOf(new Date(), Date) Output: true Explanation: The object returned by the Date constructor is, by definition, an instance of Date. Example 2: Input: func = () => { class Animal {}; class Dog extends Animal {}; return checkIfInstanceOf(new Dog(), Animal); } Output: true Explanation: class Animal {}; class Dog extends Animal {}; checkIfInstanceOf(new Dog(), Animal); // true Dog is a subclass of Animal. Therefore, a Dog object is an instance of both Dog and Animal. Example 3: Input: func = () => checkIfInstanceOf(Date, Date) Output: false Explanation: A date constructor cannot logically be an instance of itself. Example 4: Input: func = () => checkIfInstanceOf(5, Number) Output: true Explanation: 5 is a Number. Note that the ""instanceof"" keyword would return false.

The class has three public methods: set(key, value, duration) : accepts an integer key , an integer value , and a duration in milliseconds. Once the duration has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return true if the same un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists. get(key) : if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. Otherwise it should return -1 . count() : returns the count of un-expired keys.

At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 100ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned. At t=50, key=1 is requested and the value of 42 is returned. At t=50, count() is called and there is one active key in the cache. At t=100, key=1 expires. At t=150, get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.

At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 50ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned. At t=40, a key-value pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten. At t=50, get(1) is called which returned 50. At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50. At t=140, key=1 expires. At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1 is returned. At t=250, count() returns 0 because the cache is empty.

2624,Snail Traversal,"Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the snail(rowsCount, colsCount) method that transforms the 1D array into a 2D array organised in the pattern known as snail traversal order . Invalid input values should output an empty array. If rowsCount * colsCount !== nums.length , the input is considered invalid. Snail traversal order starts at the top left cell with the first value of the current array. It then moves through the entire first column from top to bottom, followed by moving to the next column on the right and traversing it from bottom to top. This pattern continues, alternating the direction of traversal with each column, until the entire current array is covered. For example, when given the input array [19, 10, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 2, 1, 17, 16, 14, 12, 18, 6, 13, 11, 20, 4, 15] with rowsCount = 5 and colsCount = 4 , the desired output matrix is shown below. Note that iterating the matrix following the arrows corresponds to the order of numbers in the original array. Example 1: Input: nums = [19, 10, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 2, 1, 17, 16, 14, 12, 18, 6, 13, 11, 20, 4, 15] rowsCount = 5 colsCount = 4 Output: [ [19,17,16,15], [10,1,14,4], [3,2,12,20], [7,5,18,11], [9,8,6,13] ] Example 2: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] rowsCount = 1 colsCount = 4 Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4]] Example 3: Input: nums = [1,3] rowsCount = 2 colsCount = 2 Output: [] Explanation: 2 multiplied by 2 is 4, and the original array [1,3] has a length of 2; therefore, the input is invalid.

2625,Flatten Deeply Nested Array,"Given a multi-dimensional array arr and a depth n , return a flattened version of that array. A multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other multi-dimensional arrays. A flattened array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than n . The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0 . Please solve it without the built-in Array.flat method. Example 1: Input arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]] n = 0 Output [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]] Explanation Passing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened. Example 2: Input arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]] n = 1 Output [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12, 13, 14, 15] Explanation The subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened. This is because their depth of 0 is less than 1. However [9, 10, 11] remains unflattened because its depth is 1. Example 3: Input arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]] n = 2 Output [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] Explanation The maximum depth of any subarray is 1.

A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array with that key. The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key. The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

A curried function is a function that accepts fewer or an equal number of parameters as the original function and returns either another curried function or the same value the original function would have returned. In practical terms, if you called the original function like sum(1,2,3) , you would call the curried version like csum(1)(2)(3) , csum(1)(2,3) , csum(1,2)(3) , or csum(1,2,3) . All these methods of calling the curried function should return the same value as the original. Example 1: Input: fn = function sum(a, b, c) { return a + b + c; } inputs = [[1],[2],[3]] Output: 6 Explanation: The code being executed is: const curriedSum = curry(fn); curriedSum(1)(2)(3) === 6; curriedSum(1)(2)(3) should return the same value as sum(1, 2, 3).

2636,Promise Pool,"Given an array of asynchronous functions functions and a pool limit n , return an asynchronous function promisePool . It should return a promise that resolves when all the input functions resolve. Pool limit is defined as the maximum number promises that can be pending at once. promisePool should begin execution of as many functions as possible and continue executing new functions when old promises resolve. promisePool should execute functions[i] then functions[i + 1] then functions[i + 2] , etc. When the last promise resolves, promisePool should also resolve. For example, if n = 1 , promisePool will execute one function at a time in series. However, if n = 2 , it first executes two functions. When either of the two functions resolve, a 3rd function should be executed (if available), and so on until there are no functions left to execute. You can assume all functions never reject. It is acceptable for promisePool to return a promise that resolves any value.

The pool size limit of 2 is reached. At t=300, the 1st function resolves, and the 3rd function is executed. Pool size is 2. At t=400, the 2nd function resolves. There is nothing left to execute. Pool size is 1. At t=500, the 3rd function resolves. Pool size is zero so the returned promise also resolves. Example 2: Input: functions = [ () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 300)), () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 400)), () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)) ] n = 5 Output: [[300,400,200],400] Explanation: The three input promises resolve at 300ms, 400ms, and 200ms respectively. The returned promise resolves at 400ms. At t=0, all 3 functions are executed. The pool limit of 5 is never met. At t=200, the 3rd function resolves. Pool size is 2. At t=300, the 1st function resolved. Pool size is 1. At t=400, the 2nd function resolves. Pool size is 0, so the returned promise also resolves.

The time limited function should follow these rules: If the fn completes within the time limit of t milliseconds, the time limited function should resolve with the result. If the execution of the fn exceeds the time limit, the time limited function should reject with the string ""Time Limit Exceeded"" .

The following image shows a triangle of side length 4 with the indexing of its triangle. Two triangles are neighbors if they share a side . For example: Triangles (1,1) and (2,2) are neighbors Triangles (3,2) and (3,3) are neighbors. Triangles (2,2) and (3,3) are not neighbors because they do not share any side. Initially, all the unit triangles are white . You want to choose k triangles and color them red . We will then run the following algorithm: Choose a white triangle that has at least two red neighbors. If there is no such triangle, stop the algorithm. Color that triangle red . Go to step 1. Choose the minimum k possible and set k triangles red before running this algorithm such that after the algorithm stops, all unit triangles are colored red. Return a 2D list of the coordinates of the triangles that you will color red initially . The answer has to be of the smallest size possible. If there are multiple valid solutions, return any. Example 1: Input: n = 3 Output: [[1,1],[2,1],[2,3],[3,1],[3,5]] Explanation: Initially, we choose the shown 5 triangles to be red. Then, we run the algorithm: - Choose (2,2) that has three red neighbors and color it red. - Choose (3,2) that has two red neighbors and color it red. - Choose (3,4) that has three red neighbors and color it red. - Choose (3,3) that has three red neighbors and color it red. It can be shown that choosing any 4 triangles and running the algorithm will not make all triangles red. Example 2: Input: n = 2 Output: [[1,1],[2,1],[2,3]] Explanation: Initially, we choose the shown 3 triangles to be red. Then, we run the algorithm: - Choose (2,2) that has three red neighbors and color it red. It can be shown that choosing any 2 triangles and running the algorithm will not make all triangles red.

2650,Design Cancellable Function,"Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise . You may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator. If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string ""Cancelled"" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed. When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error. An example of how your code would be used: function* tasks() { const val = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2)); yield new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done. } const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks()); setTimeout(cancel, 50); promise.catch(console.log); // logs ""Cancelled"" at t=50ms If instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms , the promise would have resolved 5 . Example 1: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { return 42; } cancelledAt = 100 Output: {""resolved"": 42} Explanation: const generator = generatorFunction(); const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(generator); setTimeout(cancel, 100); promise.then(console.log); // resolves 42 at t=0ms The generator immediately yields 42 and finishes. Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing. Example 2: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { const msg = yield new Promise(res => res(""Hello"")); throw `Error: ${msg}`; } cancelledAt = null Output: {""rejected"": ""Error: Hello""} Explanation: A promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error. Example 3: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200)); return ""Success""; } cancelledAt = 100 Output: {""rejected"": ""Cancelled""} Explanation: While the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error. Example 4: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { let result = 0; yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); return result; } cancelledAt = null Output: {""resolved"": 2} Explanation: 4 promises are yielded. Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise. Example 5: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { let result = 0; try { yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); yield new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); result += yield new Promise(res => res(1)); } catch(e) { return result; } return result; } cancelledAt = 150 Output: {""resolved"": 1} Explanation: The first two yielded promises resolve and cause the result to increment. However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise. Example 6: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { try { yield new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(""Promise Rejected"")); } catch(e) { let a = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); let b = yield new Promise(resolve => resolve(2)); return a + b; }; } cancelledAt = null Output: {""resolved"": 4} Explanation: The first yielded promise immediately rejects. This error is caught. Because the generator hasn't been cancelled, execution continues as usual. It ends up resolving 2 + 2 = 4. Constraints: cancelledAt == null or 0 <= cancelledAt <= 1000 generatorFunction returns a generator object",https://leetcode.ca/2023-03-03-2650-Design-Cancellable-Function

Return the lexicographically smallest string of length n , which is larger than s and is beautiful . If there is no such string, return an empty string. A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b . For example, ""abcd"" is lexicographically larger than ""abcc"" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c . Example 1: Input: s = ""abcz"", k = 26 Output: ""abda"" Explanation: The string ""abda"" is beautiful and lexicographically larger than the string ""abcz"". It can be proven that there is no string that is lexicographically larger than the string ""abcz"", beautiful, and lexicographically smaller than the string ""abda"". Example 2: Input: s = ""dc"", k = 4 Output: """" Explanation: It can be proven that there is no string that is lexicographically larger than the string ""dc"" and is beautiful.

Return the distinct difference array of nums . Note that nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j inclusive. Particularly, if i > j then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray. Example 1: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5] Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5] Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3. For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1. For index i = 2, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 3 - 2 = 1.

The root of the tree is node 1 and each node i in the tree has two children where the left child is the node 2 * i and the right child is 2 * i + 1 . Each node in the tree also has a cost represented by a given 0-indexed integer array cost of size n where cost[i] is the cost of node i + 1 . You are allowed to increment the cost of any node by 1 any number of times. Return the minimum number of increments you need to make the cost of paths from the root to each leaf node equal . Note : A perfect binary tree is a tree where each node, except the leaf nodes, has exactly 2 children. The cost of a path is the sum of costs of nodes in the path. Example 1: Input: n = 7, cost = [1,5,2,2,3,3,1] Output: 6 Explanation: We can do the following increments: - Increase the cost of node 4 one time. - Increase the cost of node 3 three times. - Increase the cost of node 7 two times. Each path from the root to a leaf will have a total cost of 9. The total increments we did is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. It can be shown that this is the minimum answer we can achieve. Example 2: Input: n = 3, cost = [5,3,3] Output: 0 Explanation: The two paths already have equal total costs, so no increments are needed.

If a given object doesn't contain a value for a given column, the cell should contain an empty string """" . The columns in the matrix should be in lexographically ascending order. Example 1: Input: arr = [ {""b"": 1, ""a"": 2}, {""b"": 3, ""a"": 4} ] Output: [ [""a"", ""b""], [2, 1], [4, 3] ] Explanation: There are two unique column names in the two objects: ""a"" and ""b"". ""a"" corresponds with [2, 4]. ""b"" coresponds with [1, 3]. Example 2: Input: arr = [ {""a"": 1, ""b"": 2}, {""c"": 3, ""d"": 4}, {} ] Output: [ [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d""], [1, 2, """", """"], ["""", """", 3, 4], ["""", """", """", """"] ] Explanation: There are 4 unique column names: ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"". The first object has values associated with ""a"" and ""b"". The second object has values associated with ""c"" and ""d"". The third object has no keys, so it is just a row of empty strings.

2676,Throttle,"Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t , return a throttled version of that function. A throttled function is first called without delay and then, for a time interval of t milliseconds, can't be executed but should store the latest function arguments provided to call fn with them after the end of the delay. For instance, t = 50ms , and the function was called at 30ms , 40ms , and 60ms . The first function call would block calling functions for the following t milliseconds. The second function call would save arguments, and the third call arguments should overwrite currently stored arguments from the second call because the second and third calls are called before 80ms . Once the delay has passed, the throttled function should be called with the latest arguments provided during the delay period, and it should also create another delay period of 80ms + t . The above diagram shows how throttle will transform events. Each rectangle represents 100ms and the throttle time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs. Example 1: Input: t = 100, calls = [ {""t"":20,""inputs"":[1]} ] Output: [{""t"":20,""inputs"":[1]}] Explanation: The 1st call is always called without delay Example 2: Input: t = 50, calls = [ {""t"":50,""inputs"":[1]}, {""t"":75,""inputs"":[2]} ] Output: [{""t"":50,""inputs"":[1]},{""t"":100,""inputs"":[2]}] Explanation: The 1st is called a function with arguments (1) without delay. The 2nd is called at 75ms, within the delay period because 50ms + 50ms = 100ms, so the next call can be reached at 100ms. Therefore, we save arguments from the 2nd call to use them at the callback of the 1st call. Example 3: Input: t = 70, calls = [ {""t"":50,""inputs"":[1]}, {""t"":75,""inputs"":[2]}, {""t"":90,""inputs"":[8]}, {""t"": 140, ""inputs"":[5,7]}, {""t"": 300, ""inputs"": [9,4]} ] Output: [{""t"":50,""inputs"":[1]},{""t"":120,""inputs"":[8]},{""t"":190,""inputs"":[5,7]},{""t"":300,""inputs"":[9,4]}] Explanation: The 1st is called a function with arguments (1) without delay. The 2nd is called at 75ms within the delay period because 50ms + 70ms = 120ms, so it should only save arguments. The 3rd is also called within the delay period, and because we need just the latest function arguments, we overwrite previous ones. After the delay period, we do a callback at 120ms with saved arguments. That callback makes another delay period of 120ms + 70ms = 190ms so that the next function can be called at 190ms. The 4th is called at 140ms in the delay period, so it should be called as a callback at 190ms. That will create another delay period of 190ms + 70ms = 260ms. The 5th is called at 300ms, but it is after 260ms, so it should be called immediately and should create another delay period of 300ms + 70ms = 370ms.

More formally, moving clockwise from the i th friend brings you to the (i+1) th friend for 1 <= i < n , and moving clockwise from the n th friend brings you to the 1 st friend. The rules of the game are as follows: 1 st friend receives the ball. After that, 1 st friend passes it to the friend who is k steps away from them in the clockwise direction. After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 2 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction. After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 3 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction, and so on and so forth. In other words, on the i th turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it to the friend who is i * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction. The game is finished when some friend receives the ball for the second time. The losers of the game are friends who did not receive the ball in the entire game. Given the number of friends, n , and an integer k , return the array answer, which contains the losers of the game in the ascending order . Example 1: Input: n = 5, k = 2 Output: [4,5] Explanation: The game goes as follows: 1) Start at 1 st friend and pass the ball to the friend who is 2 steps away from them - 3 rd friend. 2) 3 rd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 4 steps away from them - 2 nd friend. 3) 2 nd friend passes the ball to the friend who is 6 steps away from them - 3 rd friend. 4) The game ends as 3 rd friend receives the ball for the second time.

The constructor accepts an immutable object obj which will be a JSON object or array. The class has a single method produce which accepts a function mutator . The function returns a new object which is similar to the original except it has those mutations applied. mutator accepts a proxied version of obj . A user of this function can (appear to) mutate this object, but the original object obj should not actually be effected. For example, a user could write code like this: const originalObj = {""x"": 5}; const helper = new ImmutableHelper(originalObj); const newObj = helper.produce((proxy) => { proxy.x = proxy.x + 1; }); console.log(originalObj); // {""x"": 5} console.log(newObj); // {""x"": 6} Properties of the mutator function: It will always return undefined . It will never access keys that don't exist. It will never delete keys ( delete obj.key ) It will never call methods on a proxied object ( push , shift , etc). It will never set keys to objects ( proxy.x = {} ) Note on how the solution will be tested: the solution validator will only analyze differences between what was returned and the original obj . Doing a full comparison would be too computationally expensive. Also, any mutations to the original object will result in a wrong answer.

For example if you had the function: function tax(price, taxRate) { const totalCost = price * (1 + taxRate); console.log(`The cost of ${this.item} is ${totalCost}`); } Calling this function like tax(10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of undefined is 11"" . This is because the this context was not defined. However, calling the function like tax.callPolyfill({item: ""salad""}, 10, 0.1) will log ""The cost of salad is 11"" . The this context was appropriately set, and the function logged an appropriate output. Please solve this without using the built-in Function.call method. Example 1: Input: fn = function add(b) { return this.a + b; } args = [{""a"": 5}, 7] Output: 12 Explanation: fn.callPolyfill({""a"": 5}, 7); // 12 callPolyfill sets the ""this"" context to {""a"": 5}. 7 is passed as an argument. Example 2: Input: fn = function tax(price, taxRate) { return `The cost of the ${this.item} is ${price * taxRate}`; } args = [{""item"": ""burger""}, 10, 1.1] Output: ""The cost of the burger is 11"" Explanation: callPolyfill sets the ""this"" context to {""item"": ""burger""}. 10 and 1.1 are passed as additional arguments. Constraints: typeof args[0] == 'object' and args[0] != null 1 <= args.length <= 100 2 <= JSON.stringify(args[0]).length <= 10 5",https://leetcode.ca/2023-04-15-2693-Call-Function-with-Custom-Context
2694,Event Emitter,"Design an EventEmitter class. This interface is similar (but with some differences) to the one found in Node.js or the Event Target interface of the DOM. The EventEmitter should allow for subscribing to events and emitting them. Your EventEmitter class should have the following two methods: subscribe - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and a callback function. This callback function will later be called when the event is emitted. An event should be able to have multiple listeners for the same event. When emitting an event with multiple callbacks, each should be called in the order in which they were subscribed. An array of results should be returned. You can assume no callbacks passed to subscribe are referentially identical. The subscribe method should also return an object with an unsubscribe method that enables the user to unsubscribe. When it is called, the callback should be removed from the list of subscriptions and undefined should be returned. emit - This method takes in two arguments: the name of an event as a string and an optional array of arguments that will be passed to the callback(s). If there are no callbacks subscribed to the given event, return an empty array. Otherwise, return an array of the results of all callback calls in the order they were subscribed. Example 1: Input: actions = [""EventEmitter"", ""emit"", ""subscribe"", ""subscribe"", ""emit""], values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""function cb1() { return 5; }""], [""firstEvent"", ""function cb1() { return 6; }""], [""firstEvent""]] Output: [[],[""emitted"",[]],[""subscribed""],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[5,6]]] Explanation: const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.emit(""firstEvent""); // [], no callback are subscribed yet emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", function cb1() { return 5; }); emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", function cb2() { return 6; }); emitter.emit(""firstEvent""); // [5, 6], returns the output of cb1 and cb2 Example 2: Input: actions = [""EventEmitter"", ""subscribe"", ""emit"", ""emit""], values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""function cb1(...args) { return args.join(','); }""], [""firstEvent"", [1,2,3]], [""firstEvent"", [3,4,6]]] Output: [[],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[""1,2,3""]],[""emitted"",[""3,4,6""]]] Explanation: Note that the emit method should be able to accept an OPTIONAL array of arguments. const emitter = new EventEmitter(); emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent, function cb1(...args) { return args.join(','); }); emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [1, 2, 3]); // [""1,2,3""] emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [3, 4, 6]); // [""3,4,6""] Example 3: Input: actions = [""EventEmitter"", ""subscribe"", ""emit"", ""unsubscribe"", ""emit""], values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""(...args) => args.join(',')""], [""firstEvent"", [1,2,3]], [0], [""firstEvent"", [4,5,6]]] Output: [[],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[""1,2,3""]],[""unsubscribed"",0],[""emitted"",[]]] Explanation: const emitter = new EventEmitter(); const sub = emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", (...args) => args.join(',')); emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [1, 2, 3]); // [""1,2,3""] sub.unsubscribe(); // undefined emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [4, 5, 6]); // [], there are no subscriptions Example 4: Input: actions = [""EventEmitter"", ""subscribe"", ""subscribe"", ""unsubscribe"", ""emit""], values = [[], [""firstEvent"", ""x => x + 1""], [""firstEvent"", ""x => x + 2""], [0], [""firstEvent"", [5]]] Output: [[],[""subscribed""],[""emitted"",[""1,2,3""]],[""unsubscribed"",0],[""emitted"",[7]]] Explanation: const emitter = new EventEmitter(); const sub1 = emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", x => x + 1); const sub2 = emitter.subscribe(""firstEvent"", x => x + 2); sub1.unsubscribe(); // undefined emitter.emit(""firstEvent"", [5]); // [7] Constraints: 1 <= actions.length <= 10 values.length === actions.length All test cases are valid, e.g. you don't need to handle scenarios when unsubscribing from a non-existing subscription. There are only 4 different actions: EventEmitter , emit , subscribe , and unsubscribe . The EventEmitter action doesn't take any arguments. The emit action takes between either 1 or 2 arguments. The first argument is the name of the event we want to emit, and the 2nd argument is passed to the callback functions. The subscribe action takes 2 arguments, where the first one is the event name and the second is the callback function.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings ""AB"" or ""CD"" from s . Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain . Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new ""AB"" or ""CD"" substrings. Example 1: Input: s = ""ABFCACDB"" Output: 2 Explanation: We can do the following operations: - Remove the substring "" AB FCACDB"", so s = ""FCACDB"". - Remove the substring ""FCA CD B"", so s = ""FCAB"". - Remove the substring ""FC AB "", so s = ""FC"". So the resulting length of the string is 2. It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain. Example 2: Input: s = ""ACBBD"" Output: 5 Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.

2699,Modify Graph Edge Weights,"You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 , and an integer array edges where edges[i] = [a i , b i , w i ] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a i and b i with weight w i . Some edges have a weight of -1 ( w i = -1 ), while others have a positive weight ( w i > 0 ). Your task is to modify all edges with a weight of -1 by assigning them positive integer values in the range [1, 2 * 10 9 ] so that the shortest distance between the nodes source and destination becomes equal to an integer target . If there are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between source and destination equal to target , any of them will be considered correct. Return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if it is possible to make the shortest distance from source to destination equal to target , or an empty array if it's impossible. Note: You are not allowed to modify the weights of edges with initial positive weights. Example 1: Input: n = 5, edges = [[4,1,-1],[2,0,-1],[0,3,-1],[4,3,-1]], source = 0, destination = 1, target = 5 Output: [[4,1,1],[2,0,1],[0,3,3],[4,3,1]] Explanation: The graph above shows a possible modification to the edges, making the distance from 0 to 1 equal to 5. Example 2: Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,-1],[0,2,5]], source = 0, destination = 2, target = 6 Output: [] Explanation: The graph above contains the initial edges. It is not possible to make the distance from 0 to 2 equal to 6 by modifying the edge with weight -1. So, an empty array is returned.

2700,Differences Between Two Objects,"Write a function that accepts two deeply nested objects or arrays obj1 and obj2 and returns a new object representing their differences. The function should compare the properties of the two objects and identify any changes. The returned object should only contains keys where the value is different from obj1 to obj2 . For each changed key, the value should be represented as an array [obj1 value, obj2 value] . Keys that exist in one object but not in the other should not be included in the returned object. When comparing two arrays, the indices of the arrays are considered to be their keys. The end result should be a deeply nested object where each leaf value is a difference array. You may assume that both objects are the output of JSON.parse . Example 1: Input: obj1 = {} obj2 = { ""a"": 1, ""b"": 2 } Output: {} Explanation: There were no modifications made to obj1. New keys ""a"" and ""b"" appear in obj2, but keys that are added or removed should be ignored. Example 2: Input: obj1 = { ""a"": 1, ""v"": 3, ""x"": [], ""z"": { ""a"": null } } obj2 = { ""a"": 2, ""v"": 4, ""x"": [], ""z"": { ""a"": 2 } } Output: { ""a"": [1, 2], ""v"": [3, 4], ""z"": { ""a"": [null, 2] } } Explanation: The keys ""a"", ""v"", and ""z"" all had changes applied. ""a"" was changed from 1 to 2. ""v"" was changed from 3 to 4. ""z"" had a change applied to a child object. ""z.a"" was changed from null to 2. Example 3: Input: obj1 = { ""a"": 5, ""v"": 6, ""z"": [1, 2, 4, [2, 5, 7]] } obj2 = { ""a"": 5, ""v"": 7, ""z"": [1, 2, 3, [1]] } Output: { ""v"": [6, 7], ""z"": { ""2"": [4, 3], ""3"": { ""0"": [2, 1] } } } Explanation: In obj1 and obj2, the keys ""v"" and ""z"" have different assigned values. ""a"" is ignored because the value is unchanged. In the key ""z"", there is a nested array. Arrays are treated like objects where the indices are keys. There were two alterations to the the array: z[2] and z[3][0]. z[0] and z[1] were unchanged and thus not included. z[3][1] and z[3][2] were removed and thus not included. Example 4: Input: obj1 = { ""a"": {""b"": 1}, } obj2 = { ""a"": [5], } Output: { ""a"": [{""b"": 1}, [5]] } Explanation: The key ""a"" exists in both objects.

Likewise, to go from index 1 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[1], nums[2]) = gcd(3, 6) = 3 > 1. Example 2: Input: nums = [3,9,5] Output: false Explanation: No sequence of traversals can take us from index 0 to index 2 in this example. So, we return false. Example 3: Input: nums = [4,3,12,8] Output: true Explanation: There are 6 possible pairs of indices to traverse between: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). A valid sequence of traversals exists for each pair, so we return true.

Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3. Example 2: Input: s = ""cbbd"" Output: 3 Explanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes ""cbd"" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3.

The robots will move a unit distance each second. You are given a string s denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. 'L' means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas 'R' means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line. If two robots collide, they will start moving in opposite directions. Return the sum of distances between all the pairs of robots d seconds after the command. Since the sum can be very large, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . Note: For two robots at the index i and j , pair (i,j) and pair (j,i) are considered the same pair. When robots collide, they instantly change their directions without wasting any time. Collision happens when two robots share the same place in a moment. For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 2 going to the left, the next second they'll be both in 1 and they will change direction and the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 2, heading right. For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 1 going to the left, the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 1, heading right. Example 1: Input: nums = [-2,0,2], s = ""RLL"", d = 3 Output: 8 Explanation: After 1 second, the positions are [-1,-1,1]. Now, the robot at index 0 will move left, and the robot at index 1 will move right. After 2 seconds, the positions are [-2,0,0].

There are two painters available: A paid painter that paints the i th wall in time[i] units of time and takes cost[i] units of money. A free painter that paints any wall in 1 unit of time at a cost of 0 . But the free painter can only be used if the paid painter is already occupied . Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the n walls. Example 1: Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2] Output: 3 Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time; meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time. Thus, the total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.

2743,Count Substrings Without Repeating Character,"You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters. We call a substring special if it contains no character which has occurred at least twice (in other words, it does not contain a repeating character). Your task is to count the number of special substrings. For example, in the string ""pop"" , the substring ""po"" is a special substring, however, ""pop"" is not special (since 'p' has occurred twice). Return the number of special substrings. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, ""abc"" is a substring of ""abcd"" , but ""acd"" is not. Example 1: Input: s = ""abcd"" Output: 10 Explanation: Since each character occurs once, every substring is a special substring. We have 4 substrings of length one, 3 of length two, 2 of length three, and 1 substring of length four. So overall there are 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 special substrings. Example 2: Input: s = ""ooo"" Output: 3 Explanation: Any substring with a length of at least two contains a repeating character. So we have to count the number of substrings of length one, which is 3. Example 3: Input: s = ""abab"" Output: 7 Explanation: Special substrings are as follows (sorted by their start positions): Special substrings of length 1: ""a"", ""b"", ""a"", ""b"" Special substrings of length 2: ""ab"", ""ba"", ""ab"" And it can be shown that there are no special substrings with a length of at least three.

All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide . If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one . The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line. Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array. Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.

Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

Values should be deepmerged according to these rules: If the two values are objects, the resulting object should have all the keys that exist on either object. If a key belongs to both objects, deepmerge the two associated values. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the resulting object. If the two values are arrays, the resulting array should be the same length as the longer array. Apply the same logic as you would with objects, but treat the indices as keys. Otherwise the resulting value is obj2 . You can assume obj1 and obj2 are the output of JSON.parse() . Example 1: Input: obj1 = {""a"": 1, ""c"": 3}, obj2 = {""a"": 2, ""b"": 2} Output: {""a"": 2, ""c"": 3, ""b"": 2} Explanation: The value of obj1[""a""] changed to 2 because if both objects have the same key and their value is not an array or object then we change the obj1 value to the obj2 value. Key ""b"" with value was added to obj1 as it doesn't exist in obj1. Example 2: Input: obj1 = [{}, 2, 3], obj2 = [[], 5] Output: [[], 5, 3] Explanation: result[0] = obj2[0] because obj1[0] and obj2[0] have different types. result[2] = obj1[2] because obj2[2] does not exist.

2756,Query Batching,"Batching multiple small queries into a single large query can be a useful optimization. Write a class QueryBatcher that implements this functionality. The constructor should accept two parameters: An asynchronous function queryMultiple which accepts an array of string keys input . It will resolve with an array of values that is the same length as the input array. Each index corresponds to the value associated with input[i] . You can assume the promise will never reject. A throttle time in milliseconds t . The class has a single method. async getValue(key) . Accepts a single string key and resolves with a single string value. The keys passed to this function should eventually get passed to the queryMultiple function. queryMultiple should never be called consecutively within t milliseconds. The first time getValue is called, queryMultiple should immediately be called with that single key. If after t milliseconds, getValue had been called again, all the passed keys should be passed to queryMultiple and ultimately returned. You can assume every key passed to this method is unique. The following diagram illustrates how the throttling algorithm works. Each rectangle represents 100ms. The throttle time is 400ms. Example 1: Input: queryMultiple = async function(keys) { return keys.map(key => key + '!'); } t = 100 calls = [ {""key"": ""a"", ""time"": 10}, {""key"": ""b"", ""time"": 20}, {""key"": ""c"", ""time"": 30} ] Output: [ {""resolved"": ""a!"", ""time"": 10}, {""resolved"": ""b!"", ""time"": 110}, {""resolved"": ""c!"", ""time"": 110} ] Explanation: const batcher = new QueryBatcher(queryMultiple, 100); setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('a'), 10); // ""a!"" at t=10ms setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('b'), 20); // ""b!"" at t=110ms setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('c'), 30); // ""c!"" at t=110ms queryMultiple simply adds an ""!"" to the key At t=10ms, getValue('a') is called, queryMultiple(['a']) is immediately called and the result is immediately returned. At t=20ms, getValue('b') is called but the query is queued At t=30ms, getValue('c') is called but the query is queued. At t=110ms, queryMultiple(['a', 'b']) is called and the results are immediately returned. Example 2: Input: queryMultiple = async function(keys) { await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); return keys.map(key => key + '!'); } t = 100 calls = [ {""key"": ""a"", ""time"": 10}, {""key"": ""b"", ""time"": 20}, {""key"": ""c"", ""time"": 30} ] Output: [ {""resolved"": ""a!"", ""time"": 110}, {""resolved"": ""b!"", ""time"": 210}, {""resolved"": ""c!"", ""time"": 210} ] Explanation: This example is the same as example 1 except there is a 100ms delay in queryMultiple. The results are the same except the promises resolve 100ms later. Example 3: Input: queryMultiple = async function(keys) { await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, keys.length * 100)); return keys.map(key => key + '!'); } t = 100 calls = [ {""key"": ""a"", ""time"": 10}, {""key"": ""b"", ""time"": 20}, {""key"": ""c"", ""time"": 30}, {""key"": ""d"", ""time"": 40}, {""key"": ""e"", ""time"": 250} {""key"": ""f"", ""time"": 300} ] Output: [ {""resolved"":""a!"",""time"":110}, {""resolved"":""e!"",""time"":350}, {""resolved"":""b!"",""time"":410}, {""resolved"":""c!"",""time"":410}, {""resolved"":""d!"",""time"":410}, {""resolved"":""f!"",""time"":450} ] Explanation: queryMultiple(['a']) is called at t=10ms, it is resolved at t=110ms queryMultiple(['b', 'c', 'd']) is called at t=110ms, it is resolved at 410ms queryMultiple(['e']) is called at t=250ms, it is resolved at 350ms queryMultiple(['f']) is called at t=350ms, it is resolved at 450ms Constraints: 0 <= t <= 1000 0 <= calls.length <= 10 1 <= key.length <= 100 All keys are unique",https://leetcode.ca/2023-06-17-2756-Query-Batching

2776,Convert Callback Based Function to Promise Based Function,"Write a function that accepts another function fn and converts the callback-based function into a promise-based function. The function fn takes a callback as its first argument, along with any additional arguments args passed as separate inputs. The promisify function returns a new function that should return a promise. The promise should resolve with the argument passed as the first parameter of the callback when the callback is invoked without error, and reject with the error when the callback is called with an error as the second argument. The following is an example of a function that could be passed into promisify . function sum(callback, a, b) { if (a < 0 || b < 0) { const err = Error('a and b must be positive'); callback(undefined, err); } else { callback(a + b); } } This is the equivalent code based on promises: async function sum(a, b) { if (a < 0 || b < 0) { throw Error('a and b must be positive'); } else { return a + b; } } Example 1: Input: fn = (callback, a, b, c) => { callback(a * b * c); } args = [1, 2, 3] Output: {""resolved"": 6} Explanation: const asyncFunc = promisify(fn); asyncFunc(1, 2, 3).then(console.log); // 6 fn is called with a callback as the first argument and args as the rest. The promise based version of fn resolves a value of 6 when called with (1, 2, 3). Example 2: Input: fn = (callback, a, b, c) => { callback(a * b * c, ""Promise Rejected""); } args = [4, 5, 6] Output: {""rejected"": ""Promise Rejected""} Explanation: const asyncFunc = promisify(fn); asyncFunc(4, 5, 6).catch(console.log); // ""Promise Rejected"" fn is called with a callback as the first argument and args as the rest. As the second argument, the callback accepts an error message, so when fn is called, the promise is rejected with a error message provided in the callback.

Note that this definition implies that arr can have at most one dominant element. You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n with one dominant element. You can split nums at an index i into two arrays nums[0, ..., i] and nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] , but the split is only valid if: 0 <= i < n - 1 nums[0, ..., i] , and nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] have the same dominant element. Here, nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j , both ends being inclusive. Particularly, if j < i then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray.

Bob wants to select exactly m i chocolates such that his relative loss is minimized , more formally, if, in total, Alice has paid a i and Bob has paid b i , Bob wants to minimize b i - a i . Return an integer array ans where ans[i] is Bob's minimum relative loss possible for queries[i] . Example 1: Input: prices = [1,9,22,10,19], queries = [[18,4],[5,2]] Output: [34,-21] Explanation: For the 1 st query Bob selects the chocolates with prices [1,9,10,22]. He pays 1 + 9 + 10 + 18 = 38 and Alice pays 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 4. So Bob's relative loss is 38 - 4 = 34. For the 2 nd query Bob selects the chocolates with prices [19,22].

He pays 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 14 and Alice pays 0 + 0 + 4 + 6 = 10. So Bob's relative loss is 14 - 10 = 4. For the 2 nd query Bob has to select all the chocolates. He pays 1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 28 and Alice pays 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. So Bob's relative loss is 28 - 12 = 16. For the 3 rd query Bob selects the chocolates with prices [1,3,11] and he pays 1 + 3 + 7 = 11 and Alice pays 0 + 0 + 4 = 4. So Bob's relative loss is 11 - 4 = 7.

It can be shown that these are the minimum possible relative losses. Example 3: Input: prices = [5,6,7], queries = [[10,1],[5,3],[3,3]] Output: [5,12,0] Explanation: For the 1 st query Bob selects the chocolate with price 5 and he pays 5 and Alice pays 0. So Bob's relative loss is 5 - 0 = 5. For the 2 nd query Bob has to select all the chocolates. He pays 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 and Alice pays 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. So Bob's relative loss is 15 - 3 = 12. For the 3 rd query Bob has to select all the chocolates. He pays 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 and Alice pays 2 + 3 + 4 = 9. So Bob's relative loss is 9 - 9 = 0.

2821,Delay the Resolution of Each Promise,"Given an array functions and a number ms , return a new array of functions. functions is an array of functions that return promises. ms represents the delay duration in milliseconds. It determines the amount of time to wait before resolving each promise in the new array. Each function in the new array should return a promise that resolves after a delay of ms milliseconds, preserving the order of the original functions array. The delayAll function should ensure that each promise from functions is executed with a delay, forming the new array of functions returning delayed promises. Example 1: Input: functions = [ () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 30)) ], ms = 50 Output: [80] Explanation: The promise from the array would have resolved after 30 ms, but it was delayed by 50 ms, thus 30 ms + 50 ms = 80 ms. Example 2: Input: functions = [ () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 50)), () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 80)) ], ms = 70 Output: [120,150] Explanation: The promises from the array would have resolved after 50 ms and 80 ms, but they were delayed by 70 ms, thus 50 ms + 70 ms = 120 ms and 80 ms + 70 ms = 150 ms.

2838,Maximum Coins Heroes Can Collect,"There is a battle and n heroes are trying to defeat m monsters. You are given two 1-indexed arrays of positive integers heroes and monsters of length n and m , respectively. heroes [i] is the power of i th hero, and monsters [i] is the power of i th monster. The i th hero can defeat the j th monster if monsters[j] <= heroes[i] . You are also given a 1-indexed array coins of length m consisting of positive integers. coins[i] is the number of coins that each hero earns after defeating the i th monster. Return an array ans of length n where ans[i] is the maximum number of coins that the i th hero can collect from this battle . Notes The health of a hero doesn't get reduced after defeating a monster. Multiple heroes can defeat a monster, but each monster can be defeated by a given hero only once. Example 1: Input: heroes = [1,4,2], monsters = [1,1,5,2,3], coins = [2,3,4,5,6] Output: [5,16,10] Explanation: For each hero, we list the index of all the monsters he can defeat: 1 st hero: [1,2] since the power of this hero is 1 and monsters[1], monsters[2] <= 1. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] = 5 coins. 2 nd hero: [1,2,4,5] since the power of this hero is 4 and monsters[1], monsters[2], monsters[4], monsters[5] <= 4. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] + coins[4] + coins[5] = 16 coins. 3 rd hero: [1,2,4] since the power of this hero is 2 and monsters[1], monsters[2], monsters[4] <= 2. So this hero collects coins[1] + coins[2] + coins[4] = 10 coins. So the answer would be [5,16,10]. Example 2: Input: heroes = [5], monsters = [2,3,1,2], coins = [10,6,5,2] Output: [23] Explanation: This hero can defeat all the monsters since monsters[i] <= 5. So he collects all of the coins: coins[1] + coins[2] + coins[3] + coins[4] = 23, and the answer would be [23]. Example 3: Input: heroes = [4,4], monsters = [5,7,8], coins = [1,1,1] Output: [0,0] Explanation: In this example, no hero can defeat a monster. So the answer would be [0,0], Constraints: 1 <= n == heroes.length <= 10 5 1 <= m == monsters.length <= 10 5 coins.length == m 1 <= heroes[i], monsters[i], coins[i] <= 10 9",https://leetcode.ca/2023-09-07-2838-Maximum-Coins-Heroes-Can-Collect

2842,Count K-Subsequences of a String With Maximum Beauty,"You are given a string s and an integer k . A k-subsequence is a subsequence of s , having length k , and all its characters are unique , i.e ., every character occurs once. Let f(c) denote the number of times the character c occurs in s . The beauty of a k-subsequence is the sum of f(c) for every character c in the k-subsequence. For example, consider s = ""abbbdd"" and k = 2 : f('a') = 1 , f('b') = 3 , f('d') = 2 Some k-subsequences of s are: "" ab bbdd"" -> ""ab"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') = 4 "" a bbb d d"" -> ""ad"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('d') = 3 ""a b bb d d"" -> ""bd"" having a beauty of f('b') + f('d') = 5 Return an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose beauty is the maximum among all k-subsequences . Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. Notes f(c) is the number of times a character c occurs in s , not a k-subsequence. Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string. Example 1: Input: s = ""bcca"", k = 2 Output: 4 Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 1, and f('c') = 2.

For each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make the weight of every edge on the path from a i to b i equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and change its weight to any value. Note that: Queries are independent of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its initial state on each new query. The path from a i to b i is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with node a i and ending with node b i such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree. Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the answer to the i th query.

For any cell (i, j) , we represent its remoteness as R[i][j] which is defined as the following: If the cell (i, j) is a non-blocked cell, R[i][j] is the sum of the values grid[x][y] such that there is no path from the non-blocked cell (x, y) to the cell (i, j) . For blocked cells, R[i][j] == 0 . Return the sum of R[i][j] over all cells. Example 1: Input: grid = [[-1,1,-1],[5,-1,4],[-1,3,-1]] Output: 39 Explanation: In the picture above, there are four grids. The top-left grid contains the initial values in the grid. Blocked cells are colored black, and other cells get their values as it is in the input. In the top-right grid, you can see the value of R[i][j] for all cells. So the answer would be the sum of them. That is: 0 + 12 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 10 + 0 = 39.

Blocked cells are colored black, and other cells get their values as it is in the input. In the top-right grid, you can see the value of R[i][j] for all cells. So the answer would be the sum of them. That is: 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 7 + 0 + 0 = 13. Let's jump on the bottom-left grid in the above picture and calculate R[0][2] (the target cell is colored green). We should sum up the value of cells that can't be reached by the cell (0, 2). This cell is colored yellow in this grid. So R[0][2] = 3. Now let's jump on the bottom-right grid in the above picture and calculate R[2][0] (the target cell is colored green). We should sum up the value of cells that can't be reached by the cell (2, 0). These cells are colored yellow in this grid. So R[2][0] = 3 + 4 = 7. Example 3: Input: grid = [[1]] Output: 0 Explanation: Since there are no other cells than (0, 0), R[0][0] is equal to 0. So the sum of R[i][j] over all cells would be 0. Constraints: 1 <= n <= 300 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10 6 or grid[i][j] == -1",https://leetcode.ca/2023-09-21-2852-Sum-of-Remoteness-of-All-Cells

2868,The Wording Game,"Alice and Bob each have a lexicographically sorted array of strings named a and b respectively. They are playing a wording game with the following rules: On each turn, the current player should play a word from their list such that the new word is closely greater than the last played word; then it's the other player's turn. If a player can't play a word on their turn, they lose. Alice starts the game by playing her lexicographically smallest word. Given a and b , return true if Alice can win knowing that both players play their best, and false otherwise. A word w is closely greater than a word z if the following conditions are met: w is lexicographically greater than z . If w 1 is the first letter of w and z 1 is the first letter of z , w 1 should either be equal to z 1 or be the letter after z 1 in the alphabet. For example, the word ""care"" is closely greater than ""book"" and ""car"" , but is not closely greater than ""ant"" or ""cook"" . A string s is lexicographically greater than a string t if in the first position where s and t differ, string s has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in t . If the first min(s.length, t.length) characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically greater one. Example 1: Input: a = [""avokado"",""dabar""], b = [""brazil""] Output: false Explanation: Alice must start the game by playing the word ""avokado"" since it's her smallest word, then Bob plays his only word, ""brazil"", which he can play because its first letter, 'b', is the letter after Alice's word's first letter, 'a'. Alice can't play a word since the first letter of the only word left is not equal to 'b' or the letter after 'b', 'c'. So, Alice loses, and the game ends. Example 2: Input: a = [""ananas"",""atlas"",""banana""], b = [""albatros"",""cikla"",""nogomet""] Output: true Explanation: Alice must start the game by playing the word ""ananas"". Bob can't play a word since the only word he has that starts with the letter 'a' or 'b' is ""albatros"", which is smaller than Alice's word. So Alice wins, and the game ends. Example 3: Input: a = [""hrvatska"",""zastava""], b = [""bijeli"",""galeb""] Output: true Explanation: Alice must start the game by playing the word ""hrvatska"". Bob can't play a word since the first letter of both of his words are smaller than the first letter of Alice's word, 'h'. So Alice wins, and the game ends. Constraints: 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10 5 a[i] and b[i] consist only of lowercase English letters. a and b are lexicographically sorted . All the words in a and b combined are distinct .

We want to group the indices so for each index i in the range [0, n - 1] , it is assigned to exactly one group. A group assignment is valid if the following conditions hold: For every group g , all indices i assigned to group g have the same value in nums . For any two groups g 1 and g 2 , the difference between the number of indices assigned to g 1 and g 2 should not exceed 1 . Return an integer denoting the minimum number of groups needed to create a valid group assignment. Example 1: Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,3] Output: 2 Explanation: One way the indices can be assigned to 2 groups is as follows, where the values in square brackets are indices: group 1 -> [0,2,4] group 2 -> [1,3] All indices are assigned to one group. In group 1, nums[0] == nums[2] == nums[4], so all indices have the same value. In group 2, nums[1] == nums[3], so all indices have the same value. The number of indices assigned to group 1 is 3, and the number of indices assigned to group 2 is 2. Their difference doesn't exceed 1. It is not possible to use fewer than 2 groups because, in order to use just 1 group, all indices assigned to that group must have the same value. Hence, the answer is 2.

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of letter changes required. Notes A string is a palindrome if it can be read the same way from left to right and right to left. A string with a length of len is considered a semi-palindrome if there exists a positive integer d such that 1 <= d < len and len % d == 0 , and if we take indices that have the same modulo by d , they form a palindrome . For example, ""aa"" , ""aba"" , ""adbgad"" , and, ""abab"" are semi-palindrome and ""a"" , ""ab"" , and, ""abca"" are not. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Example 1: Input: s = ""abcac"", k = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: We can divide s into substrings ""ab"" and ""cac"". The string ""cac"" is already a semi-palindrome. If we change ""ab"" to ""aa"", it becomes a semi-palindrome with d = 1. It can be shown that there is no way to divide the string ""abcac"" into two semi-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the answer would be at least 1. Example 2: Input: s = ""abcdef"", k = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: We can divide it into substrings ""abc"" and ""def"".

2919,Minimum Increment Operations to Make Array Beautiful,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums having length n , and an integer k . You can perform the following increment operation any number of times ( including zero ): Choose an index i in the range [0, n - 1] , and increase nums[i] by 1 . An array is considered beautiful if, for any subarray with a size of 3 or more , its maximum element is greater than or equal to k . Return an integer denoting the minimum number of increment operations needed to make nums beautiful . A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. Example 1: Input: nums = [2,3,0,0,2], k = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: We can perform the following increment operations to make nums beautiful: Choose index i = 1 and increase nums[1] by 1 -> [2,4,0,0,2]. Choose index i = 4 and increase nums[4] by 1 -> [2,4,0,0,3]. Choose index i = 4 and increase nums[4] by 1 -> [2,4,0,0,4]. The subarrays with a size of 3 or more are: [2,4,0], [4,0,0], [0,0,4], [2,4,0,0], [4,0,0,4], [2,4,0,0,4]. In all the subarrays, the maximum element is equal to k = 4, so nums is now beautiful. It can be shown that nums cannot be made beautiful with fewer than 3 increment operations. Hence, the answer is 3. Example 2: Input: nums = [0,1,3,3], k = 5 Output: 2 Explanation: We can perform the following increment operations to make nums beautiful: Choose index i = 2 and increase nums[2] by 1 -> [0,1,4,3]. Choose index i = 2 and increase nums[2] by 1 -> [0,1,5,3]. The subarrays with a size of 3 or more are: [0,1,5], [1,5,3], [0,1,5,3]. In all the subarrays, the maximum element is equal to k = 5, so nums is now beautiful. It can be shown that nums cannot be made beautiful with fewer than 2 increment operations. Hence, the answer is 2. Example 3: Input: nums = [1,1,2], k = 1 Output: 0 Explanation: The only subarray with a size of 3 or more in this example is [1,1,2]. The maximum element, 2, is already greater than k = 1, so we don't need any increment operation. Hence, the answer is 0.

2920,Maximum Points After Collecting Coins From All Nodes,"There exists an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 . You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 , where edges[i] = [a i , b i ] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a i and b i in the tree. You are also given a 0-indexed array coins of size n where coins[i] indicates the number of coins in the vertex i , and an integer k . Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected. Coins at node i can be collected in one of the following ways: Collect all the coins, but you will get coins[i] - k points. If coins[i] - k is negative then you will lose abs(coins[i] - k) points. Collect all the coins, but you will get floor(coins[i] / 2) points. If this way is used, then for all the node j present in the subtree of node i , coins[j] will get reduced to floor(coins[j] / 2) . Return the maximum points you can get after collecting the coins from all the tree nodes. Example 1: Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], coins = [10,10,3,3], k = 5 Output: 11 Explanation: Collect all the coins from node 0 using the first way. Total points = 10 - 5 = 5. Collect all the coins from node 1 using the first way. Total points = 5 + (10 - 5) = 10. Collect all the coins from node 2 using the second way so coins left at node 3 will be floor(3 / 2) = 1. Total points = 10 + floor(3 / 2) = 11. Collect all the coins from node 3 using the second way. Total points = 11 + floor(1 / 2) = 11. It can be shown that the maximum points we can get after collecting coins from all the nodes is 11. Example 2: Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], coins = [8,4,4], k = 0 Output: 16 Explanation: Coins will be collected from all the nodes using the first way. Therefore, total points = (8 - 0) + (4 - 0) + (4 - 0) = 16.

2921,Maximum Profitable Triplets With Increasing Prices II,"Given the 0-indexed arrays prices and profits of length n . There are n items in an store where the i th item has a price of prices[i] and a profit of profits[i] . We have to pick three items with the following condition: prices[i] < prices[j] < prices[k] where i < j < k . If we pick items with indices i , j and k satisfying the above condition, the profit would be profits[i] + profits[j] + profits[k] . Return the maximum profit we can get, and -1 if it's not possible to pick three items with the given condition. Example 1: Input: prices = [10,2,3,4], profits = [100,2,7,10] Output: 19 Explanation: We can't pick the item with index i=0 since there are no indices j and k such that the condition holds. So the only triplet we can pick, are the items with indices 1, 2 and 3 and it's a valid pick since prices[1] < prices[2] < prices[3]. The answer would be sum of their profits which is 2 + 7 + 10 = 19. Example 2: Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5], profits = [1,5,3,4,6] Output: 15 Explanation: We can select any triplet of items since for each triplet of indices i, j and k such that i < j < k, the condition holds. Therefore the maximum profit we can get would be the 3 most profitable items which are indices 1, 3 and 4. The answer would be sum of their profits which is 5 + 4 + 6 = 15.

2933,High-Access Employees,"You are given a 2D 0-indexed array of strings, access_times , with size n . For each i where 0 <= i <= n - 1 , access_times[i][0] represents the name of an employee, and access_times[i][1] represents the access time of that employee. All entries in access_times are within the same day. The access time is represented as four digits using a 24-hour time format, for example, ""0800"" or ""2250"" . An employee is said to be high-access if he has accessed the system three or more times within a one-hour period . Times with exactly one hour of difference are not considered part of the same one-hour period. For example, ""0815"" and ""0915"" are not part of the same one-hour period. Access times at the start and end of the day are not counted within the same one-hour period. For example, ""0005"" and ""2350"" are not part of the same one-hour period.

Second figure represents the state of the matrix after one right and left cyclic shifts to even and odd indexed rows. Third figure is the final state of the matrix after two cyclic shifts which is similar to the initial matrix. Therefore, return true. Example 2: Input: mat = [[2,2],[2,2]], k = 3 Output: true Explanation: As all the values are equal in the matrix, even after performing cyclic shifts the matrix will remain the same. Therefeore, we return true. Example 3: Input: mat = [[1,2]], k = 1 Output: false Explanation: After one cyclic shift, mat = [[2,1]] which is not equal to the initial matrix. Therefore we return false. Constraints: 1 <= mat.length <= 25 1 <= mat[i].length <= 25 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 25 1 <= k <= 50",https://leetcode.ca/2023-12-24-2946-Matrix-Similarity-After-Cyclic-Shifts

You are allowed to do any number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy either of these two conditions: The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with either b < c or d < a . In other words, the indices picked in both operations are disjoint . The substrings picked in the operations are source[a..b] and source[c..d] with a == c and b == d . In other words, the indices picked in both operations are identical . Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations . If it is impossible to convert source to target , return -1 . Note that there may exist indices i , j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i] . Example 1: Input: source = ""abcd"", target = ""acbe"", original = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""c"",""e"",""d""], changed = [""b"",""c"",""b"",""e"",""b"",""e""], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20] Output: 28 Explanation: To convert ""abcd"" to ""acbe"", do the following operations: - Change substring source[1..1] from ""b"" to ""c"" at a cost of 5. - Change substring source[2..2] from ""c"" to ""e"" at a cost of 1. - Change substring source[2..2] from ""e"" to ""b"" at a cost of 2. - Change substring source[3..3] from ""d"" to ""e"" at a cost of 20. The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28. It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost. Example 2: Input: source = ""abcdefgh"", target = ""acdeeghh"", original = [""bcd"",""fgh"",""thh""], changed = [""cde"",""thh"",""ghh""], cost = [1,3,5] Output: 9 Explanation: To convert ""abcdefgh"" to ""acdeeghh"", do the following operations: - Change substring source[1..3] from ""bcd"" to ""cde"" at a cost of 1. - Change substring source[5..7] from ""fgh"" to ""thh"" at a cost of 3. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation. - Change substring source[5..7] from ""thh"" to ""ghh"" at a cost of 5. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation, and identical with indices picked in the second operation. The total cost incurred is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost. Example 3: Input: source = ""abcdefgh"", target = ""addddddd"", original = [""bcd"",""defgh""], changed = [""ddd"",""ddddd""], cost = [100,1578] Output: -1 Explanation: It is impossible to convert ""abcdefgh"" to ""addddddd"". If you select substring source[1..3] as the first operation to change ""abcdefgh"" to ""adddefgh"", you cannot select substring source[3..7] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation. If you select substring source[3..7] as the first operation to change ""abcdefgh"" to ""abcddddd"", you cannot select substring source[1..3] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation. Constraints: 1 <= source.length == target.length <= 1000 source , target consist only of lowercase English characters. 1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 100 1 <= original[i].length == changed[i].length <= source.length original[i] , changed[i] consist only of lowercase English characters. original[i] != changed[i] 1 <= cost[i] <= 10 6",https://leetcode.ca/2024-01-08-2977-Minimum-Cost-to-Convert-String-II

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array, queries , where queries[i] = [a i , b i , c i , d i ] . For each query i , you are allowed to perform the following operations: Rearrange the characters within the substring s[a i :b i ] , where 0 <= a i <= b i < n / 2 . Rearrange the characters within the substring s[c i :d i ] , where n / 2 <= c i <= d i < n . For each query, your task is to determine whether it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing the operations. Each query is answered independently of the others. Return a 0-indexed array answer , where answer[i] == true if it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing operations specified by the i th query, and false otherwise. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. s[x:y] represents the substring consisting of characters from the index x to index y in s , both inclusive . Example 1: Input: s = ""abcabc"", queries = [[1,1,3,5],[0,2,5,5]] Output: [true,true] Explanation: In this example, there are two queries: In the first query: - a 0 = 1, b 0 = 1, c 0 = 3, d 0 = 5. - So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:1] => a b cabc and s[3:5] => abc abc . - To make s a palindrome, s[3:5] can be rearranged to become => abc cba . - Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true. In the second query: - a 1 = 0, b 1 = 2, c 1 = 5, d 1 = 5. - So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abc abc and s[5:5] => abcab c . - To make s a palindrome, s[0:2] can be rearranged to become => cba abc. - Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[1] = true. Example 2: Input: s = ""abbcdecbba"", queries = [[0,2,7,9]] Output: [false] Explanation: In this example, there is only one query. a 0 = 0, b 0 = 2, c 0 = 7, d 0 = 9. So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abb cdecbba and s[7:9] => abbcdec bba . It is not possible to make s a palindrome by rearranging these substrings because s[3:6] is not a palindrome. So, answer[0] = false. Example 3: Input: s = ""acbcab"", queries = [[1,2,4,5]] Output: [true] Explanation: In this example, there is only one query. a 0 = 1, b 0 = 2, c 0 = 4, d 0 = 5. So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:2] => a cb cab and s[4:5] => acbc ab . To make s a palindrome s[1:2] can be rearranged to become a bc cab. Then, s[4:5] can be rearranged to become abcc ba .

The price of a number num is the number of i 's such that i % x == 0 and s[i] is a set bit . Return the greatest integer num such that the sum of prices of all numbers from 1 to num is less than or equal to k . Note : In the binary representation of a number set bit is a bit of value 1 .

Since x is equal to 1, the price of each number is the number of its set bits. The number of set bits in these numbers is 9. So the sum of the prices of the first 6 numbers is 9. So the answer is 6. Example 2: Input: k = 7, x = 2 Output: 9 Explanation: Since x is equal to 2, we should just check even th bits. The second bit of binary representation of numbers 2 and 3 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2. The second bit of binary representation of numbers 6 and 7 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2. The fourth bit of binary representation of numbers 8 and 9 is a set bit but their second bit is not. So the sum of their prices is 2. Numbers 1, 4, and 5 don't have set bits in their even th bits in their binary representation. So the sum of their prices is 0. The second and the fourth bit of the binary representation of the number 10 are a set bit. So its price is 2. The sum of the prices of the first 9 numbers is 6.

A region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold . All pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions. You need to calculate a 0-indexed m x n grid result , where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the region to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] belongs to multiple regions, result[i][j] is the average of the rounded down average intensities of these regions, rounded down to the nearest integer.

As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9. Please note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67.

The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27.

Note that you do not necessarily need to add the same characters that you removed. However, you must perform both operations at every second. Return the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state . Example 1: Input: word = ""abacaba"", k = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters ""aba"" from the prefix of word, and add characters ""bac"" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to ""cababac"". At the 2nd second, we remove characters ""cab"" from the prefix of word, and add ""aba"" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to ""abacaba"" and reverts to its initial state. It can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state. Example 2: Input: word = ""abacaba"", k = 4 Output: 1 Explanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters ""abac"" from the prefix of word, and add characters ""caba"" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to ""abacaba"" and reverts to its initial state. It can be shown that 1 second is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state. Example 3: Input: word = ""abcbabcd"", k = 2 Output: 4 Explanation: At every second, we will remove the first 2 characters of word, and add the same characters to the end of word.

Where 0 <= board[r][c] <= 9 and each element of pattern is either a digit or a lowercase English letter. Your task is to find a submatrix of board that matches pattern . An integer matrix part matches pattern if we can replace cells containing letters in pattern with some digits (each distinct letter with a unique digit) in such a way that the resulting matrix becomes identical to the integer matrix part . In other words, The matrices have identical dimensions. If pattern[r][c] is a digit, then part[r][c] must be the same digit. If pattern[r][c] is a letter x : For every pattern[i][j] == x , part[i][j] must be the same as part[r][c] . For every pattern[i][j] != x , part[i][j] must be different than part[r][c] .

3092,Most Frequent IDs,"The problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that changes over time. You have two integer arrays, nums and freq , of equal length n . Each element in nums represents an ID, and the corresponding element in freq indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step. Addition of IDs: If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are added to the collection at step i . Removal of IDs: If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are removed from the collection at step i . Return an array ans of length n , where ans[i] represents the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after the i th step. If the collection is empty at any step, ans[i] should be 0 for that step. Example 1: Input: nums = [2,3,2,1], freq = [3,2,-3,1] Output: [3,3,2,2] Explanation: After step 0, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2. So ans[0] = 3 . After step 1, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2 and 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[1] = 3 . After step 2, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 2 . After step 3, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3 and 1 ID with the value of 1. So ans[3] = 2 . Example 2: Input: nums = [5,5,3], freq = [2,-2,1] Output: [2,0,1] Explanation: After step 0, we have 2 IDs with the value of 5. So ans[0] = 2 . After step 1, there are no IDs. So ans[1] = 0 . After step 2, we have 1 ID with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 1 . Constraints: 1 <= nums.length == freq.length <= 10 5 1 <= nums[i] <= 10 5 -10 5 <= freq[i] <= 10 5 freq[i] != 0 The input is generated such that the occurrences of an ID will not be negative in any step.",https://leetcode.ca/2024-04-12-3092-Most-Frequent-IDs

You are given two integers kx and ky where (kx, ky) denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array positions where positions[i] = [x i , y i ] denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard. Alice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn: The player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the fewest possible moves . Note that the player can select any pawn, it might not be one that can be captured in the least number of moves. In the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight may pass other pawns without capturing them . Only the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.

For example, if s[i] = 'a' and nums[0] = 3 , the character 'a' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in ""bcd"" . The transformation wraps around the alphabet if it exceeds 'z' . For example, if s[i] = 'y' and nums[24] = 3 , the character 'y' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in ""zab"" .

3506,Find Time Required to Eliminate Bacterial Strains,"You are given an integer array timeReq and an integer splitTime . In the microscopic world of the human body, the immune system faces an extraordinary challenge: combatting a rapidly multiplying bacterial colony that threatens the body's survival. Initially, only one white blood cell ( WBC ) is deployed to eliminate the bacteria. However, the lone WBC quickly realizes it cannot keep up with the bacterial growth rate. The WBC devises a clever strategy to fight the bacteria: The i th bacterial strain takes timeReq[i] units of time to be eliminated. A single WBC can eliminate only one bacterial strain. Afterwards, the WBC is exhausted and cannot perform any other tasks. A WBC can split itself into two WBCs, but this requires splitTime units of time. Once split, the two WBCs can work in parallel on eliminating the bacteria. Only one WBC can work on a single bacterial strain. Multiple WBCs cannot attack one strain in parallel. You must determine the minimum time required to eliminate all the bacterial strains. Note that the bacterial strains can be eliminated in any order. Example 1: Input: timeReq = [10,4,5], splitTime = 2 Output: 12 Explanation: The elimination process goes as follows: Initially, there is a single WBC. The WBC splits into 2 WBCs after 2 units of time. One of the WBCs eliminates strain 0 at a time t = 2 + 10 = 12. The other WBC splits again, using 2 units of time. The 2 new WBCs eliminate the bacteria at times t = 2 + 2 + 4 and t = 2 + 2 + 5 .

You are also given a 2D array queries , where queries[i] = [index i , value i , start i , x i ] . You are allowed to perform an operation once on nums , where you can remove any suffix from nums such that nums remains non-empty . The x-value of nums for a given x is defined as the number of ways to perform this operation so that the product of the remaining elements leaves a remainder of x modulo k . For each query in queries you need to determine the x-value of nums for x i after performing the following actions: Update nums[index i ] to value i . Only this step persists for the rest of the queries. Remove the prefix nums[0..(start i - 1)] (where nums[0..(-1)] will be used to represent the empty prefix). Return an array result of size queries.length where result[i] is the answer for the i th query. A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the array and extends to any point within it. A suffix of an array is a subarray that starts at any point within the array and extends to the end of the array. Note that the prefix and suffix to be chosen for the operation can be empty .

3568,Minimum Moves to Clean the Classroom,"You are given an m x n grid classroom where a student volunteer is tasked with cleaning up litter scattered around the room. Each cell in the grid is one of the following: 'S' : Starting position of the student 'L' : Litter that must be collected (once collected, the cell becomes empty) 'R' : Reset area that restores the student's energy to full capacity, regardless of their current energy level (can be used multiple times) 'X' : Obstacle the student cannot pass through '.' : Empty space You are also given an integer energy , representing the student's maximum energy capacity. The student starts with this energy from the starting position 'S' . Each move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) costs 1 unit of energy. If the energy reaches 0, the student can only continue if they are on a reset area 'R' , which resets the energy to its maximum capacity energy . Return the minimum number of moves required to collect all litter items, or -1 if it's impossible. Example 1: Input: classroom = [""S."", ""XL""], energy = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: The student starts at cell (0, 0) with 2 units of energy. Since cell (1, 0) contains an obstacle 'X', the student cannot move directly downward. A valid sequence of moves to collect all litter is as follows: Move 1: From (0, 0) → (0, 1) with 1 unit of energy and 1 unit remaining. Move 2: From (0, 1) → (1, 1) to collect the litter 'L' . The student collects all the litter using 2 moves. Thus, the output is 2. Example 2: Input: classroom = [""LS"", ""RL""], energy = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: The student starts at cell (0, 1) with 4 units of energy. A valid sequence of moves to collect all litter is as follows: Move 1: From (0, 1) → (0, 0) to collect the first litter 'L' with 1 unit of energy used and 3 units remaining.

Each stage j has a speed multiplier mul[j] : If mul[j] > 1 , the trip slows down. If mul[j] < 1 , the trip speeds up. Each individual i has a rowing strength represented by time[i] , the time (in minutes) it takes them to cross alone in neutral conditions. Rules: A group g departing at stage j takes time equal to the maximum time[i] among its members, multiplied by mul[j] minutes to reach the destination. After the group crosses the river in time d , the stage advances by floor(d) % m steps. If individuals are left behind, one person must return with the boat. Let r be the index of the returning person, the return takes time[r] × mul[current_stage] , defined as return_time , and the stage advances by floor(return_time) % m . Return the minimum total time required to transport all individuals. If it is not possible to transport all individuals to the destination, return -1 . Example 1: Input: n = 1, k = 1, m = 2, time = [5], mul = [1.0,1.3] Output: 5.00000 Explanation: Individual 0 departs from stage 0, so crossing time = 5 × 1.00 = 5.00 minutes. All team members are now at the destination. Thus, the total time taken is 5.00 minutes. Example 2: Input: n = 3, k = 2, m = 3, time = [2,5,8], mul = [1.0,1.5,0.75] Output: 14.50000 Explanation: The optimal strategy is: Send individuals 0 and 2 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 8) × mul[0] = 8 × 1.00 = 8.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(8.00) % 3 = 2 , so the next stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2 . Individual 0 returns alone from the destination to the base camp from stage 2. The return time is 2 × mul[2] = 2 × 0.75 = 1.50 minutes. The stage advances by floor(1.50) % 3 = 1 , so the next stage is (2 + 1) % 3 = 0 . Send individuals 0 and 1 from the base camp to the destination from stage 0. The crossing time is max(2, 5) × mul[0] = 5 × 1.00 = 5.00 minutes. The stage advances by floor(5.00) % 3 = 2 , so the final stage is (0 + 2) % 3 = 2 . All team members are now at the destination. The total time taken is 8.00 + 1.50 + 5.00 = 14.50 minutes. Example 3: Input: n = 2, k = 1, m = 2, time = [10,10], mul = [2.0,2.0] Output: -1.00000 Explanation: Since the boat can only carry one person at a time, it is impossible to transport both individuals as one must always return. Thus, the answer is -1.00 . Constraints: 1 <= n == time.length <= 12 1 <= k <= 5 1 <= m <= 5 1 <= time[i] <= 100 m == mul.length 0.5 <= mul[i] <= 2.0",https://leetcode.ca/2025-07-26-3594-Minimum-Time-to-Transport-All-Individuals

3600,Maximize Spanning Tree Stability with Upgrades,"You are given an integer n , representing n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and a list of edges , where edges[i] = [u i , v i , s i , must i ] : u i and v i indicates an undirected edge between nodes u i and v i . s i is the strength of the edge. must i is an integer (0 or 1). If must i == 1 , the edge must be included in the spanning tree . These edges cannot be upgraded . You are also given an integer k , the maximum number of upgrades you can perform. Each upgrade doubles the strength of an edge, and each eligible edge (with must i == 0 ) can be upgraded at most once. The stability of a spanning tree is defined as the minimum strength score among all edges included in it. Return the maximum possible stability of any valid spanning tree. If it is impossible to connect all nodes, return -1 . Note : A spanning tree of a graph with n nodes is a subset of the edges that connects all nodes together (i.e. the graph is connected ) without forming any cycles, and uses exactly n - 1 edges. Example 1: Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2,1],[1,2,3,0]], k = 1 Output: 2 Explanation: Edge [0,1] with strength = 2 must be included in the spanning tree. Edge [1,2] is optional and can be upgraded from 3 to 6 using one upgrade. The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 2 and 6. The minimum strength in the spanning tree is 2, which is the maximum possible stability. Example 2: Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,4,0],[1,2,3,0],[0,2,1,0]], k = 2 Output: 6 Explanation: Since all edges are optional and up to k = 2 upgrades are allowed.

Example 1: Input: c = 5, connections = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], queries = [[1,3],[2,1],[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]] Output: [3,2,3] Explanation: Initially, all stations {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are online and form a single power grid. Query [1,3] : Station 3 is online, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 3. Query [2,1] : Station 1 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {2, 3, 4, 5} . Query [1,1] : Station 1 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {2, 3, 4, 5} , which is station 2. Query [2,2] : Station 2 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {3, 4, 5} . Query [1,2] : Station 2 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {3, 4, 5} , which is station 3. Example 2: Input: c = 3, connections = [], queries = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]] Output: [1,-1] Explanation: There are no connections, so each station is its own isolated grid. Query [1,1] : Station 1 is online in its isolated grid, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 1. Query [2,1] : Station 1 goes offline. Query [1,1] : Station 1 is offline and there are no other stations in its grid, so the result is -1.

3608,Minimum Time for K Connected Components,"You are given an integer n and an undirected graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 . This is represented by a 2D array edges , where edges[i] = [u i , v i , time i ] indicates an undirected edge between nodes u i and v i that can be removed at time i . You are also given an integer k . Initially, the graph may be connected or disconnected. Your task is to find the minimum time t such that after removing all edges with time <= t , the graph contains at least k connected components. Return the minimum time t . A connected component is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

3638,Maximum Balanced Shipments,"You are given an integer array weight of length n , representing the weights of n parcels arranged in a straight line. A shipment is defined as a contiguous subarray of parcels. A shipment is considered balanced if the weight of the last parcel is strictly less than the maximum weight among all parcels in that shipment. Select a set of non-overlapping , contiguous, balanced shipments such that each parcel appears in at most one shipment (parcels may remain unshipped). Return the maximum possible number of balanced shipments that can be formed. Example 1: Input: weight = [2,5,1,4,3] Output: 2 Explanation: We can form the maximum of two balanced shipments as follows: Shipment 1: [2, 5, 1] Maximum parcel weight = 5 Last parcel weight = 1, which is strictly less than 5. Thus, it's balanced. Shipment 2: [4, 3] Maximum parcel weight = 4 Last parcel weight = 3, which is strictly less than 4. Thus, it's balanced. It is impossible to partition the parcels to achieve more than two balanced shipments, so the answer is 2. Example 2: Input: weight = [4,4] Output: 0 Explanation: No balanced shipment can be formed in this case: A shipment [4, 4] has maximum weight 4 and the last parcel's weight is also 4, which is not strictly less. Thus, it's not balanced. Single-parcel shipments [4] have the last parcel weight equal to the maximum parcel weight, thus not balanced.

A robot starts at the top-left corner of the grid (0, 0) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1) . It can move only right or down . If the robot attempts to move into a mirror cell, it is reflected before entering that cell: If it tries to move right into a mirror, it is turned down and moved into the cell directly below the mirror. If it tries to move down into a mirror, it is turned right and moved into the cell directly to the right of the mirror. If this reflection would cause the robot to move outside the grid boundaries, the path is considered invalid and should not be counted. Return the number of unique valid paths from (0, 0) to (m - 1, n - 1) . Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10 9 + 7 . Note : If a reflection moves the robot into a mirror cell, the robot is immediately reflected again based on the direction it used to enter that mirror: if it entered while moving right, it will be turned down; if it entered while moving down, it will be turned right. This process will continue until either the last cell is reached, the robot moves out of bounds or the robot moves to a non-mirror cell. Example 1: Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]] Output: 5 Explanation: Number Full Path 1 (0, 0) → (0, 1) [M] → (1, 1) → (1, 2) [M] → (2, 2) 2 (0, 0) → (0, 1) [M] → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) 3 (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) [M] → (2, 2) 4 (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) 5 (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) [M] → (2, 1) → (2, 2) [M] indicates the robot attempted to enter a mirror cell and instead reflected. Example 2: Input: grid = [[0,0],[0,0]] Output: 2 Explanation: Number Full Path 1 (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) 2 (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) Example 3: Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,1,0]] Output: 1 Explanation: Number Full Path 1 (0, 0) → (0, 1) [M] → (1, 1) [M] → (1, 2) (0, 0) → (1, 0) [M] → (1, 1) [M] → (2, 1) goes out of bounds, so it is invalid. Constraints: m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 2 <= m, n <= 500 grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1 . grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0",https://leetcode.ca/2025-10-05-3665-Twisted-Mirror-Path-Count
